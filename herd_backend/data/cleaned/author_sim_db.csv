 16. Project Management Unit","Narisma, Gemma T.","The CHED PHERNet-AdMU Program has been conducting its research projects in
 collaboration with communities within and outside Metro Manila, such as those from Rizal,
 Tarlac, Mindoro, Naga, and Cagayan de Oro. These resulted in 8 ISI/Scopus published articles
 and 2 submissions during Years 2012-2014. While for the Years 2014-2016, 12 ISI/Scopus
 published articles and 2 submissions were produced. In addition to these are paper
 presentations, both local and international.
 Hoping to pursue with the third program of PHERNet-AdMU covering the years 2017-2018,
 the attached proposals discuss how each project will continue with addressing disaster risk
 reduction and long-term resilience and adaptive capacity towards sustainable development.
 The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world when it comes to
 disasters, and ranks high in terms of the number of natural disasters that have occurred from
 1976-2005. Results of a recent World Risk Report in 2016 show that the Philippines ranks
 second when it comes to being at risk to disasters (next to Vanuatu) mainly because of its
 physical exposure to natural hazards.
 In light of Climate Change and with extreme events more likely to occur in the future due to
 the effects of global warming, it is essential to have a research program that will provide
 evidence and information for disaster risk management that aims for long term resilience and
 geared towards future sustainable development. This calls for a holistic and integrative
 program research framework for disaster risk analysis that will study in depth the three
 crucial variables that lead to disasters: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability.
 The main goal of this program is to build and generate knowledge in disaster risk reduction
 and long-term adaptive capacity and risk resilience towards evidence-based sustainable
 development. This program will delve into the factors that affect the risk to disasters through
 collaborative and multidisciplinary research.
 
 In this research program, the approach to disaster risk reduction is through a multi-
 disciplinary, multi-dimensional and multi-variable research analysis, where risk can be
 
 characterized as the product of the complex interactions within , and between different
 variables evolving from the physical threat or impact of the (extreme) event (or the hazard),
 the exposed elements to the hazard (exposure), and the susceptibility, coping ability and
 adaptive capacity of the exposed elements (or vulnerability). The program aims to have the
 following outcomes:

"Antimycotic Activity Of Nostoc Linckia  Species against Tinea Versicolor in Lagangilang, Abra","Paderes, Nero M.","The warm tropical climate of the Philippines and its interaction with cultural practices, age, occupation, genetic susceptibilities and immune responsiveness contribute to the increased susceptibility of Filipinos to fungal infections. The severity of the disease have increased in recent years significantly due to heavy infections and the pathogenic fungi becoming resistant due to indiscriminate use of antibiotic drugs.  The decreased efficiency and resistance of pathogen to antifungal drugs has necessitated the development of new alternatives. Aquatic organisms such as algae are a rich source of structurally novel and biologically active compounds. The province of Abra is home to a diverse group of algal species many of which are not yet fully documented and studied as to their potential commercial, industrial and medicinal value. This species of algae is locally known as Tabtaba and is scientifically classified as Nostoc linkia which is common in Northern Luzon. 
Four treatments were utilized which includes Nostoc linckia ethanolic extracts at 800 and 400 ¬µg dose concentration, positive control (1gm/ml teramycine)and negative control (distilled water). The modified Kirby Bauer Disc diffusion method was used to test for the antimycotic activity of the 4 treatments. Findings show that T1 and T3 exhibited a strong antimycotic activity with a mean zone of inhibition of 17.85 mm and 27.32 mm respectively, while T2 exhibited a moderate activity with a mean zone of inhibition of 13.18 mm while T4 being the negative control showed no zone of inhibition. ANOVA and Sheffe analysis confirms that Tinea versicolor is highly sensitive to the inhibitory effect of the different treatments. The researcher recommends another study to be conducted against other pathogenic fungal species to obtain a more valid information on the antimycotic activity of Nostoc linckia.

Performance of Three varieties of Hybrid Rice Under Rainfed and Irrigated Conditions,"Tadeo, Stephen","This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of three varieties of hybrid rice in rainfed and irrigated conditions. Specifically, to determine the following; the best hybrid rice varieties in terms of growth and yield under rainfed and irrigated conditions; the growth and yield performance of the different varieties under rainfed and irrigated conditions; the economic performance of the different varieties under irrigated and rainfed condition; and the relationship between herbage and grain yield. 
  The experiment was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design involving two factors. Factor A; was the moisture regime which was observed as rainfed condition (upper bund) and irrigated condition (lower bund). Factor B; was the different varieties planted on both conditions. The total experimental area was divided into six blocks representing the replications. This study was conducted in Lagben, Lagangilang, Abra from July 09, 2017 to November 02, 2017.
Result showed that significant difference observed mostly in irrigated condition. The number of grains per panicle and filled grains per panicle were very pronounced. Hybrid rice varieties are comparable with the inbred variety. 
  In terms of ROI and net income, Pioneer 77 got the highest net income of 209.74 under rainfed and 187.69 under irrigated and an ROI of 74.13 in rainfed and 64.43 in irrigated. 
The best hybrid rice variety in terms of growth and yield parameters was V2 (Pioneer 77) across conditions; this was attributed to high number of grains, filled grains and have the heaviest weight.  The hybrid rice varieties performs best under irrigated condition rather than in rainfed condition.
Pioneer 77 was the best variety among all varieties tested in terms of growth and yield; therefore, it is recommended for rainfed and irrigated conditions in Abra. Studies using other varieties and management practices should also be studied in the area to further improve yield, hence sustainable productivity.

Specifically, it aims to determine the respondents‚Äô concept of a clean and honest election; respondents‚Äô impression and vision of 2019 Midterm Election; respondents‚Äô experiences, impressions and observations in the political ecology of Abra; respondents‚Äô targeted participation in the 2019 Midterm election and their corresponding expectations from the elected officials; areas in the curriculum where topics and electoral-related activities focus on voter education are integrated.
This study utilized the quantitative-qualitative method. It is descriptive in nature, as it describes the respondents‚Äô impressions of the targeted topic. Respondents are the first year students of the College of Teacher Education, 2nd semester SY 2018-2019, with a total of 103, whose ages range from 18 ‚Äì 22, and comprised of 22 males and 81 females. They are the first-time electorates. The gathering of data was conducted from March 11 ‚Äì 27, 2019. 
 This study utilized a researcher-made questionnaire to elicit answers from respondents on the respondents‚Äô concept of a clean and honest election; their impressions and vision of 2019 Midterm Election; the respondents‚Äô experiences, impressions and observations in the political ecology of Abra. There are also questions probing the subjects or courses and election-related topics focused on voter education were tackled; their intended involvement and participation in attaining a clean and honest election; and their expectations from the elected officials. Focus group discussion was done during the conduct of the survey.
During their vacant period, the students were requested to answer the questionnaire explained item by item basis for a clearer understanding by the respondents. The respondents are directed to answer in the mother-tongue (Iloko) to express exactly what they felt and what they mean. Frequency counts and computed percentages were used in presenting the data. Impressions given by the respondents are unanimously and qualitatively considered in the discussions. 
The following are the findings: 1). The following are the definitions of the respondents of a clean and honest election. A clean and honest election is when there is NO vote buying and NO vote selling; when vote is casted without being dictated and without pressure; when one can freely vote for the candidate who is honest, humble, dedicated qualified for the position, and, who can be of help to the people; When during the election period, there are NO killings, threatening, harassment/coercion, fraud/cheating during canvassing nor blackmailing; When the candidates humbly accept defeat and respect and support  the one who wins, do not destroy other candidates‚Äô reputation during campaign, fulfill platforms presented during the campaign period, follow COMELEC guidelines, and, practice healthy competition; and, when the people in the community are united and of healthy relationships, disciplined, not divided according to political affiliations, and are honest, understanding, and loving; 2). The respondents are uncertain that the 2019 Midterm Election is a clean and honest election because of their impression that there is vote buying and vote selling, there are killings correlated to be politically motivated, there are cases of politically motivated harassments, there are cases of intimidations among the political affiliates, and, there are disputes among the people due to differences in political affiliations. But despite these negative impressions, they dream to be a clean and honest election; 3). A negative impression on the political ecology of Abra is posed by the respondents. They consider Abra not peaceful during election due to rampant vote buying and siblings, relatives and neighborhood are found forming rivalries due to differences in political views; 4). The respondents posed positive actions to be undertaken in the attainment of a clean and honest election like exercising their right of suffrage, protecting the sanctity of the election, and serving the best way they can. In like manner, they expect the elected officials of an excellent leadership, strict implementation of peace and order, and a model of good behavior as public servant; and, 5). Very few respondents cited subjects undertaken in high school that included voter education and other election-related topics being discussed.
It is concluded that: 1. The respondents reflected in their definitions of clean and honest election their feelings of the cases of fraud observed and experienced during election time; 2. Despite the negative impressions of the respondents on the 2019 Midterm election, they did not lose their hope of achieving the best election result; 3. Abra needs rehabilitation through the concerted effort of different line agencies including schools resulting to an improved political ecology; 4. When given proper venue, the respondents would be active participants in activities resulting to the attainment of a clean and honest election. Moreover, they are to emulate good leadership and governance from the elected public servants; and, 5). There is a  need for the respondents to be informed of election-related topics focused on voter education. 
It is hereby recommended that: 1). A voter education and other election-related topics and activities should be initiated and undertaken in school; 2). The school to conduct intervention heightening students‚Äô participation in activities that are of great help in eliminating election mockery in the province; 3). Long term school based activities through the concerted effort of the different line agencies of the government should be undertaken resulting to an improved political ecology of the province; 4).

Maizecheck: A Web Application For Identifying Maize Foliar Diseases,"Tuzon, Amor;Baldemor, Romeo","Maize also called Corn, is the most produced grain in the world. Ranum P., et al, 2014, stated that maize is believed to have originated in central Mexico 7000 years ago from a wild grass, and Native Americans transformed maize into a better source of food. Maize is considered to be a great source of carbohydrates, iron, vitamin B, and minerals and can be processed into a variety of food and industrial products, such as starch, sweeteners, oil, beverages, glue, industrial alcohol, and fuel ethanol.
In the Philippines, maize is second to rice as the most important crop, with one-third of Filipino farmers, or 1.8 million, depending on maize as their major source of livelihood (Gerpacio, R. V., J. D. Labios, R. V. Labios, and E. I. Diangkinay, 2004). 
However, like any other high value crops, maize is vulnerable to infections by plant pathogens throughout the growing season under favorable environmental conditions such as leaf diseases in mid-season.
The researcher then conducted a study with regards to foliar diseases of maize in order to create a technology that would help the farmers and even the concern organization like the Department of Agriculture (DA) to identify maize foliar diseases as a substitute/addendum of present techniques. This study will help improve the production of maize most especially in the province of Abra. Amanda Ramcharan, Kelsee Baranowski, Peter McCloskey, Babuali Ahmed, James Legg and David P.

Teaching in the ‚ÄúNew Normal‚Äù: Thoughts and Experiences of Teachers on The Shape of The Academe,"Enriquez, Alexis A.","The globe was disheveled disastrously with a pandemic at the onset of the first months of 2020. The COVID-19 or the Corona Virus which began in Wuhan, Hubei Province in China on December 2019 spread in the Philippines that it had its first case on January 2020 with a female Chinese, 38 years of age and had its first local case on March 7, 2020. While learning must go on during the pandemic, a paradigm shift is crucial to have a meaningful remote learning experience. While lecturers are slowly adjusting to remote instruction, there are some teaching and learning elements that cannot be replicated at home.
This qualitative- descriptive research focused on the thoughts and 
experiences of the 16 teachers as they try to reorder and reorganize themselves in the academe. Constrained by the pandemic, responses were collected using the google form and themed accordingly. It used the Thematic Analysis of Braun and Clarke (2006) as a method in analysing the data. The teachers revealed empowerment, trustworthiness of officials, negation, readiness, hopefulness, time management, elusiveness, flexibility, and security shaped them in several aspects amidst this pandemic while realizing the importance of serving students with utmost quality. 
As schools cope with the pandemic, the administrators, government officials, and others must also be thinking of how the school can recover faster, with a transformed sense of responsibility, a better understanding and sense of firmness of the need to bridge the gap in opportunities and assuring that all students have the same chances for a quality education. The call to quality service among them serves as a lifelong mission and as academic frontliners with the responsiveness to mitigate the challeneges of the pandemic must also be offered with maximum safety.

Rationalizing the Extension Programs of Abra State Institute of Sciences and Technology,"Gannapao, Jubert S.","Extension Department has a vital role in extending the programs to the community. Specifically this study aimed to rationalize the extension programs of the Abra State Institute of Sciences and Technology based on the level of awareness, level of participation and level of satisfaction among the beneficiaries on the implementation of Extension Programs. Objectives of the study were: To determine significant relationship between the level of awareness and the level of participation and significant relationship between the levels of participation with the level of satisfaction of the beneficiaries, and To determine effectiveness are the strategies, extent of implementation and significant relationship between the effectiveness of strategies and the extent of implementation and challenges in the implementation of the Extension Programs of ASIST.
The study utilized the structured questionnaire as the main data-gathering instrument, interview and focus group discussions (FGD). The research made use of statistical tools which are the frequency counting and percentages, weighted mean, and Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (PPMCC).
 Results of the study showed that, most of the beneficiaries perceived that the level of awareness in Information and communication services has the highest average mean value of 3.13 described as Moderately aware. Majority of the beneficiaries perceived that the level of participation in Information and communication services recorded the highest average mean value of 2.78 described as Slight participation. Most of the beneficiaries perceived that the level of satisfaction in Information and communication services has the highest average mean value of 2.86 described as Moderately satisfied. The null hypothesis is rejected since there is a significant relationship between the level of awareness and level of participation among the beneficiaries in the implementation of extension programs. The null hypothesis is rejected since there is a significant relationship between the level of participation and the level of satisfaction among the beneficiaries in the implementation of extension programs. Most of the program implementers perceived the level of effectiveness of strategies in training services. Most of the program implementers perceived the extent of implementation in Information and communication services. The null hypothesis is rejected since there is a significant relationship between the effectiveness of strategies and the extent of implementation of extension services among the program implementers of Abra State Institute of Sciences and Technology. Program implementers perceived that most of the enumerated financial challenges affected their programs. 
Based on the conclusions the Extension Department should initiate a method to encourage, motivate and increase the level of awareness, level of participation and the level of satisfaction of the beneficiaries particularly on those program services that were rated low. The Extension Department should innovate and transform more meaningful strategies for better implementation of the program services. The Extension Department should strengthen their services in order to achieve, sustain the vision, mission, goals and objectives of the institution and the unit. The Extension Department should conduct quarterly assessment and evaluation in order to verify and check whether the program services that is being extended to the community have an impact and improved the quality of life of the beneficiaries. There is a need for a closer contact with the beneficiaries to foster better understanding and active participation. The program implementers should be more visible in the area of responsibility so that they would know based on first-hand data the needs of the beneficiaries/clientele, and to show their concern to them. Program implementers should look for more linkages with the different agencies and organizations such as local, national and international arena. From the shortcomings of the implementers as being analyzed from the study, it is hoped that these should not be taken negatively, but rather should serve as a basis for succeeding assessment and evaluation and for further improvement of their implementation process. The study was conducted for the province of Abra, however, a region-wide study will give more insights on the existing condition of Extension Programs, and to test the validity of the findings. 
To rationalize the Extension Services of the Abra State Institute of Sciences and Technology the following model may be adopt. The ASENSO, which is an Ilocano word/term means ‚ÄúPROGRESSIVE/DEVELOPING‚Äù. For every letter of the word, there is a corresponding definition; Action, Service-oriented, Effective-efficient, Noble, Sustainable, and Opportunities. The meaning of every letter of the word ASENSO, will lead to a progressive institution and better implementation of the Extension Programs of Abra State Institute of Sciences and Technology.

In Defense of Death: An Existentialist Approach to The Concept of Death,"Roldan, Roberto Q. Jr.","Death is a reality that nobody can escape from. It is a fact of one‚Äôs existence that the moment one breaths in the air of life, he or she will eventually die. Death is then ever present in one‚Äôs life but it is a concept that one usually talks about it because of the emotions attach with it especially with the passing away of a love one. But it is with this same feeling of a loss of a love one that has prompted this writer to see deeper on the reality of death to fully understand and embrace it rather than running away from it or brushing it away from his consciousness.
Death for him then is an event ‚Äì every man should prepare for this unscheduled occasion; a celebration ‚Äì a man‚Äôs journey is recognized; a gateway to the unknown ‚Äì a travel to a destination or is the destination itself; necessary pain ‚Äì the only passage way to the unknown, a producer ‚Äì creates emotional  fear in man, creates longing for a being higher than man - God  and give rise to the promises of religions; awakens good values among the family, relatives and friends of the departed ‚Äì sacrifice, generosity and forgiveness; a giver ‚Äì greater appreciation of life, opportunity for reconciliation and reunite as friends, family, clan, nation or human beings; eternal sleep of man‚Äôs consciousness ‚Äì end of man‚Äôs craving of temporal needs and desire, creates the absence of bodily, psychological and emotional pain; great equalizer ‚Äì everyone is equal in death regardless of language, race culture, religion, spirituality, functionalities and relations and finally death is Real ‚Äì a reality that no living being could escape from that makes an individual appreciate and live the life he or she have right here and now.
In unexpected manner, it has brought into the writers consciousness that in understanding about death, especially during the onslaught of the COVID19 Pandemic, has led him into appreciating life, no matter how fragile and temporary it is. He can now say that in dealing with and embracing the concept of death is an invitation to deeper appreciation of one‚Äôs existence, to live in the here and now.

Performance of Rubber in Heavy Rainfall Condition,"Marzo Jr., Fernando L.","This study aimed to evaluate the rubber clones in marginal areas because of the global trends in pushing the rubber plantations in marginal areas and shortage of land for rubber cultivation. A rubber plantation ready for tapping at ASSCAT, Bunawan, Agusan del Sur was evaluated as to its performance under heavy rainfall condition. The experiment was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications. There were seven clones recommended for commercial planting and all clones performed well in terms of average yield (g/t/t) and (g/t/mo) in heavy rainfall areas. Rubber trees planted in heavy rainfall areas perform well provided that some intervention (rubber rain guard) will be created to maximize production. ",ASSCAT,Main

On Fractional and Fractal Derivatives in Relation to the Physics of Fractals,"Padua, Roberto N.;Herrera, Miraluna;Sabugaa, Michael;Patac Jr., Adriano;Borres, Marc S.;Ontolan, Jay M.","Fractional  and  fractal  derivatives  are  both  generalizations  of  the  usual  derivatives  that  consider derivatives of non-integer orders.  Interest in these generalizations has been triggered by a resurgence of clamor to develop a mathematical tool to describe ‚Äúroughness‚Äù in the spirit of  Mandelbrot‚Äôs  (1967)  fractal  geometry.  Fractional  derivatives  take  the  analytic  approach  towards developing a rational order derivative while fractal derivatives follow a more concrete, albeit  geometric  approach  to  the  same  end.  Since  both  approaches  alleged  to  extend  whole  derivatives  to  rational  derivatives,  it  is  not  surprising  that  confusion  will  arise  over  which  generalization to use in practice. This paper attempts to highlight the connection between the various  generalizations  to  fractional  and  fractal  derivatives  with  the  end-in-view  of  making  these concepts useful in various physics applications and to resolve some of the confusion that arise out of the fundamental philosophical differences in the derivation of fractional derivatives (non-local concept) and fractal derivatives (local concept).",ASSCAT,Main

 Project Components:
 1. Data Generation: Data Sourcing and Secondary Data Content Review 
 2. System Generation: System Development, Deployment and Testing 
 3. Report Generation: Mapping of Emerging Industry Landscape in ASEAN Economic Cooperation Member Countries 
 4. Impact Analysis of Changing Industry Landscape to Higher Education","Almanzor, Nuna","The study is divided into 4 components namely data generation, solutions generation, reports generation and
 impact analysis.
 First phase, Data Generation: Data Sourcing and Secondary Data Content Review is consist of: 1) Extensive
 review of secondary data from government agencies that caters business registration such as the Department of
 Trade and Industry (DTI) and business permit registrations at selected Local Government Units (LGU) or its
 equivalent agencies in the ASEAN countries; 2) Review of existing databases which will be sources of technical,
 technological and knowledge information representing the current trend of interests of inventors, innovators,
 researchers, businesses and industries such as patent databases and journal publications databases; and, 3)
 Review of the country-specific industry road map and international development issues as source of defining
 emerging industries. These secondary data and databases will give ample information on the identification of
 emerging industries in each ASEAN countries. At the end of this phase, it is expected that the needed information
 are present in each database and that it is possible to mine those data and integrate.
 Second phase, System Generation: System Development, Deployment and Testing consist of utilizing various
 technologies such as artificial intelligence, data science and information integration techniques employed in big
 data analytics in the development of possible solutions to successfully conduct data-mining from secondary data
 information and existing databases. The mined data will be transformed into alive and usable data to attain the
 expected output of the study. At the end of this phase, it is expected that a customized system will be designed
 and developed that will explore sources of information and data will be transformed into structured data in the
 objective of further processing the sets of information leading to desired output. The system will be deployed in the
 identified databases of the countries involved in the study.
 Third phase, Report Generation: Mapping of Emerging Industry Landscape in ASEAN Economic Cooperation
 Member Countries consist of generating various visualization models such as maps and graphs which will be
 reinforced with triangulation method to present, collate, analyze and interpret the system-processed data. The
 data presentation will aid in determining the indicators of emerging industries as well as showing its landscape. At the end of the phase, it is expected that the visual presentations will show changing industry landscapes and pin-point which industries are emerging.
 
 Fourth phase, Impact Analysis of Changing Industry Landscape to Higher Education will involve utilization of reports
 
 generated to come-up with data driven implications to each specific country involved in the study, to include cross-
 country analysis and determination of the impacts to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED).
 
 CHED‚Äôs new branding of building higher education strategic research portfolio to spawn intellectual capital with
 global intellectual competitiveness is definitely achievable and deeply rooted from a knowledge-driven economy.
 Every human being passes through education and training, then after which, join an industry. The product of higher
 education known as graduates translates to human resources needed by industries.
 There is a strong link between stakeholders. First, interplay between the academe and industry which should be
 complementing. While the industry road map is aligned with the national development plan in achieving long-term
 
 aspirations, the academe must have its track aligned with the industry road map. In consideration of the fast-
 changing technologies, some industries are dying while some are emerging. Second, interplay of the academe and
 
 industry with the community and environment, as stakeholders. This relationship changed the industry landscape
 by ensuing that economic activities will improve human well-being and social equity while significantly reducing
 environmental risks and ecological scarcities. Emerging industries caters emerging technologies that promote
 production and consumption modes that are environmentally and socially sustainable viz-a-viz inclusive
 development.
 The scenario, if not forecasted on a timely manner will result into a big mismatch between the needs of the industry
 and the quality of human resource produced by higher education. There is need to understand the implications of
 emerging industry landscape to program offerings, curriculum design and training programs. Moreover, the
 education system is meant to prepare human resource to supply a regional need by way of responding to the
 ASEAN Economic Cooperation (AEC). Benchmarking on neighboring countries that are ahead or behind each
 other will create a dynamic cooperation fostering a healthy economic exchange. Widening the scope of the study
 by extending to the ten ASEAN member countries will result in a more in-depth understanding of the why‚Äôs and
 how‚Äôs of global competitiveness.
 There are existing databases containing huge collection of actual knowledge and economic generation activities
 that are readily available and are even integrated with analytics to show various processed information. Three
 important data sources are of interest to the research proponents. These are: 1) business registry ‚Äì actual business
 registrations and operations; 2) patent registry ‚Äì actual technical innovations filed; and, 3) publications registry ‚Äì
 actual academic and scholarly works. These databases feature the major movements in terms of the industry,
 inventions (from industry and academe) and researches (from academe) that are current intellectual interests
 referenced from the global patterns perceived. But to integrate all information into one seems unimaginable when
 done manually.
 To address the gap, dynamic big data analytics must be employed to facilitate data gathering, processing,
 presentation, visualization, interpretation and inference of pertinent information that will tag problem before it
 actually happens. This study will pose a solution bridging information based on three important data sources.
 The main objective of the study is to employ big data analytics techniques in mapping the emerging industries
 landscape of the ASEAN member countries and its implications in higher education. Specifically, it will address the
 following: 1) Review the current industrial development plan specifically the industry roadmaps of the ASEAN
 member countries and international development issues; 2) Map the landscape of industries in key cities of each
 country utilizing information data-mining from national and local business registry, patent registry and publications
 registry; 3) Compare actual industry landscape on its alignment with country-specific industry roadmap,
 international developmental issues and cross-country analysis; 4) Identify which among the industries are emerging
 on basis of country-specific industry profile and ASEAN industry profile; and, 5) Identify the implications of the
 mapped industry landscape to higher education in terms of emerging jobs, program offerings, curriculum designs
 and training programs, industry-academe matching and regional competitiveness.
 Descriptive, experimental and historical research methodologies will be employed. Various techniques will be used
 such as secondary data review, qualitative and quantitative data analysis, system development, visualization
 techniques, comparative matrix (cross-tabulation) analysis and triangulation method.
 The expected outputs of the study are: Collated, merged and compared national and international roadmap;
 database generator; system development for modeling and forecasting, maps, landscapes and models, big data
 integration, industry status list (i.e. emerging); mind-mapping for emerging industries; implications to higher
 education.
 Valuable outcomes of the study are: Memorandum of Agreements with partner agencies, entities and enterprises
 for access and sharing of information; Memorandum of Cooperation for collaborating foreign higher education
 institutions; formation of a ASEAN Consortium on Emerging Technologies; advertising slogans for snap data;
 performance analysis of each country via ranking system; compilations of lessons learned from strategies of
 ASEAN countries; personality and network with the top industry and business groups; and, data driven policies.
 
 The intellectual merit of the proposed activity is a revolutionized modeling that will aid in more technical innovation
 to be developed.
 
 The impacts on higher education are: setting new directions on curriculum enhancement; capacity building and re-
 training programs; forecast of future skills and competencies lists and programs offerings; data driven policy
 
 reforms for improving the regional and global ranking.
 The wider impact to the study are: the scholarly community will have a concrete basis of future research interests;
 the society directly benefits on emerging technology trends; the innovation landscape will be influenced based on
 cross-country analysis; and the industry will know the critical mass of innovations based on merged data (which is
 not yet available at present) as catalysts for moving forward amidst posed adversities by rapid technological
 change. Both higher education and industries will be forewarned of what to happen in the future thereby eliminating
 losses and wastage of effort and resources.",AU,Main
"Protective Face Masks As Preventive Measure on COVID 19 Among Front liners in the Municipality of San Ildefonso, Bulacan","Adriano, Jennifer P.","Corona Virus Disease 19 also known as CoViD19 was first detected in Wuhan, China last December 2019 and now declared as pandemic by the World
 Health Organization that have been infected over 3 million people with almost 240,000 deaths. With these numbers of cases all over the world, preventive
 measures are being implemented to lessen the spread of the virus.
 Since the transmission of the virus is via sneezing or coughing due to small or large droplets of water, the government is eager to lessen the transmission by
 following strictly the preventive measures against CoVid19. Moreover, some preventive measures include frequent handwashing, using 70% isopropyl alcohol,
 disinfecting surface, wearing masks and do self quarantine if symptoms persist.
 San Ildefonso, Bulacan is a first class municipality in the province of Bulacan with a land area of 128.71 square kilometers and with a population of nearly
 105,000. More so, Municipality of San Ildefonso is composed of 36 barangays headed by the responsible Mayor in the name of Ms. Carla Galvez Tan. This town

In some remote area, it is still considered as staple food in Dumolpos, Dalupirip, Itogon and Camandag, Asipulo, Ifugao. Mostly sweetpotato vines and roots are utilized as animal feeds. The Northern Philippines Rootcrop Research and Training Center at Benguet State University had developed technologies on sweetpotato hopia and yoghurt using 'Bengueta', a yellow fleshed and 'Haponita', a dark purple fleshed cultivar. Sweetpotato 'Bengueta', NSIC approved cultivar as BSU SP 19, is a local native collection sourced from Kapangan, Benguet locally known as Tagalog. The sweetpotato 'Haponita' is a foreign sourced with dark purple colored fleshed with high anthocyanin content and a suitable substitute for ubi.

"Students‚Äô Understanding of Physics Concepts, Attitude, Engagement, and Perceptions in a Flipped Classroom Environment","Bawang, Ederson G;Prudente, Maricar S.","Science education has always been dealt with challenges. Poor performance, low engagement, negative attitudes, and seemingly, the technological divide between teachers and students are allegedly identified as the culprits. Nevertheless, teachers have always adapted with the significant changes in the environment, especially in these days of social media. It is in this light that the study was conducted. The research endeavor investigated the learners performance, attitude, engagement and understanding towards learning physics under a flipped classroom. Specifically, the research endeavor sought to determine the 1) level of performance in physics of the students under a flipped classroom model in terms of their quizzes and problem-solving 2) students reflections regarding how physics concepts are applied in real-life situations 3) effect of the flipped learning environment on students engagement and attitude and 4) students and teacher experts views and perceptions regarding the video lectures.
 The study used the Mixed Methods approach that involved two parts: the quantitative and qualitative. The qualitative part was used to deepen the quantitative result. A total of 37 students were considered in the study. The intervention lasted for 8 weeks. Permission was sought to conduct the study from persons of authority and officers in charge of the school where the study was conducted. During the conduct of the vii intervention, the gathering of information regarding students reflections and scores were simultaneously done. Handwritten reflections were re-encoded electronically, rated, and recorded. Questionnaires on attitude towards learning physics and student engagement were distributed to and answered by the participants before and after the intervention. For the face-to-face learning, the students and their teacher were meeting at the designated classroom authorized by the school. Finally, a series of interview with 9 randomly selected students were held in a form of focus group discussion regarding the intervention the students have just undergone.
 Results of the study reveal that overall, the participants performance in quizzes and problem-solving have been Very Good. Reflections of participants indicate that physics concepts are mostly seen in their lives as students i.e. going to school, playing sports, and riding vehicles. The difference between mean scores of student engagement proved to be significant before and after the flipped classroom intervention. There also exists a significant difference between the mean scores of student attitude towards learning physics before and after intervention. There were mostly positive views that were elicited from the students regarding the video lectures. Teacher-experts perceive that the video lectures have appropriate instructional and technical design.
 These are the recommendations from the study: Physics (but not only limited to this field) teachers are suggested to hone in on the benefits of this approach so that students can grasp and possibly alleviate their performance, especially in learning physics. Teachers are encouraged to be aware that one way of embracing the role of being a good facilitator of learning is to apply blended learning approaches in their instruction. Students who are dealing with attitude problems towards their subject matter viii or those who are seemingly disengaged can look at this approach as one way of probably improving their deficits in learning.
 Lastly, research along this line is never enough given that flipped classroom is relatively gaining ground in terms of its acceptance as a model in the educational system. And even more so in this case because this research endeavor is generally exploratory in nature. Similar studies should be conducted to affirm or validate the results of the study.",BSU,Main

Waste Handling Practices and Values of University Student,"Dolipas, Bretel B.;Ramos, Jennifer Lyn S.;Alimondo, Monica S.;Madinno, Carmelo","The study intended to determine the waste management practice of students in Benguet State University, Philippines. BSU students commonly generate vegetable wastes, papers/tissues and plastic wrappers in their households and always practice waste segregation by classifying their solid wastes and disposing them in the appropriate waste bins or containers in their households. The study also revealed that BSU students have similar household waste handling practices regardless of their sex and family origin. However, the lower level students practiced nonsegregation of household wastes compared to the higher level students. Also, waste segregation is practiced more by BSU students who are residing in the University dormitories compared to those who are residing in apartments/boarding houses. BSU students correctly segregated household wastes into biodegradable, recyclables and residuals and usually disposed of their household wastes through"" pick up by trucks;"" this was more frequently observed with female students. Also, low landers frequently disposed of their household wastes by placing all types of wastes in a compost pit as compared to the highlanders. Sophomore and freshmen students frequently practiced waste disposal by"" pick up by trucks"" and placing all types of wastes into a compost pit.

Awareness and Compliance on Waste Segregation: Implication to a Waste Management Program in a University,"Dolipas, Bretel B.;Ramos, Jennifer Lyn S.;Alimondo, Monica S.;Fulwani, Danni Loven","Proper disposal is among the most important aspects of a waste management program in an educational institution. This study was conducted in a university situated in the northern province of the Philippines and presents students‚Äô level of awareness on waste classification and their compliance level on proper waste segregation. A questionnaire was used to measure the level of awareness, whereas compliance level was measured through the audit of disposed wastes collected on segregated waste bins within the vicinity of the university. An average level of awareness on biodegradable waste was recorded among students, except for third year students who showed low level of awareness on this type of waste. Moreover, regardless of the type of residence, students showed low level of awareness in classifying waste. Generally, students‚Äô compliance level on waste segregation was very low. Registered low levels of awareness among university students may be linked to inadequate awareness campaign of the university, while low compliance level on proper waste segregation somehow calls for augmented forces to ensure strict compliance.

Models of Screening Bachelor of Science in Applied Statistics and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Freshmen Applicants,"Oryan, Serano L.;Beligan, Salvacion Z.","The study determined the initial mathematical models of screening freshmen applicants for Bachelor of Science in Applied Statistics (BSAS) and Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) programs based on their input variables such as IQ and prior achievements in English, Mathematics and Science. It also investigated the impacts of these variables on the students‚Äô college first semester performances during SY 2011-2012. The respondents were classified and profiled based on their data and corresponding models were formulated using Discriminant Analysis method. The difference of the respondents‚Äô college performances were tested using T-test. The profile of the BSIT students showed that group1 has higher IQ and lower grades while group 2 has lower IQ but higher grades. The model yielded showed that grade in Science has the stronger discriminating power. IQ has still the greatest discriminating power. The model‚Äôs Y-value of 84.86 serves as the reference value. Group 1 has Y-values higher than 84.86 while group 2 has Y-values lower than 84.86.The profile of the BSAS students showed that, except for their IQ, the two groups are not completely separated. The model showed that grades in English and Mathematics have stronger discriminating powers, next to IQ which has the greatest discriminating power. The model‚Äôs Y-value is 104.03 and group 1 has Y-values higher than 104.03 while group 2 has Y-values lower than 104.03. In both BSIT and BSAS, groups 1 and 2 showed no significant difference in their first semester college performances, indicating that at the moment group assignment is yet to be a determinant of academic achievement.

The Mathematics of Maximizing a Parallelepiped Box with Spherical Objects,"Oryan, Serano L.","This study investigated a special case of packing problems involving identical and fixed sized spherical objects and rectangular parallelepiped box. It determined the possible patterns of piling spherical objects into a parallelepiped box so that the box attains its maximum content. The study explored on the different ways of piling and identified those that yield content greater than that in ordinary piling. The effects of the dimensions of a box on whether or not it is possible to obtain a new pile that tends to increase the population density of the box is determined. The results show that there are smooth and behaved piling patterns that tend to increase the population density of the box from its default piling pattern. It is found that if the box can contain at least 5 spheres along its length, at least 3 spheres along its width and at least 4 spheres along its height, then it is possible to modify the default pile pattern so that additional spheres can be fitted into the box. The mathematics of maximizing the content of the box, or by increasing its population density, is given in theorems and corollaries. Also, the proofs of the theorems are supplied to establish their mathematical viability. The results also show that it is possible to generate mathematical models that establish deterministic algorithms of maximizing content, or increasing population density of the parallelepiped box. The mathematical models developed are recommended for use in calculating the maximal content of a given parallelepiped container. Finally, it is recommended that further investigations on the same topic be conducted as the present study is in no way exhaustive.",BSU,Main

There were 217 respondents from different degree programs and year levels who were given carefully selected non-routine problem which they solved in one hour. 
 
 
 Results showed there exist seven different knowledge construction patterns with varying degrees of success. The proportion of respondents exhibiting successful knowledge construction patterns accounts for 12.9%, partially successful, 48.93% and not successful, 39.17%, thus indicating that large proportion of students need appropriate training in solving non-routine problems to improve their solving abilities. The proportions of respondents manifesting similar knowledge construction patterns across groups, as well as their success rates, are not significantly different. The results indicate that motivation and exposure to routine mathematics are not factors that differentiate between those with successful knowledge construction patterns and those with less successful ones and that students‚Äô mathematics learnings are independent of the development of productive thinking schemata and solving abilities.",BSU,Main
"Readability, content, and mechanical feature analysis of selected commercial science textbooks intended for third grade filipino learners","Bansiong, Apler J.","Textbooks remain as major learning aids in all levels of education worldwide. Thus, textbooks must constantly be subjected to critical analysis in order to establish their curricular usefulness. This paper analyzed four commercial science textbooks designed for third grade Filipino learners. The four textbooks were analyzed according to readability and comprehensibility, content, and mechanical features. Readability was evaluated using popular readability formulas, while comprehensibility was determined using the Sonmez‚Äôs formula and the cloze test methods. The content features were the textbooks‚Äô alignment with national science standards, conceptual errors, and level of gender bias. Finally, the mechanical features were focused on printing and lay-out, and handiness of the textbooks. Readability analysis revealed that the textbooks were written three to four grade levels higher, and two to 3 years older than their intended users. The dominant reading ease of the four textbooks ranged from fairly easy to easy, which means that the texts are suitable to sixth and seventh graders. The texts were highly to perfectly aligned with the country‚Äôs national science standards. Three textbooks are generally gender fair while one has a low-level male bias. The average error/conceptual problem density is at one error in every six to eight pages. Misidentifications are the most common conceptual problems in the textbooks.

Indigenous Knowledge and Household Food Security: The Role of Roots and Tuber Crops among Indigenous Peoples in the Northern Luzon,"Gayao, Betty T.;Meldoz, Dalen T.;Backian, Grace S.","The indigenous peoples of Northern Philippines have always considered roots and tubers as staple food and vegetable. With the changing lifestyles of the younger generation and the
 lack of documentation, indigenous knowledge on roots and tubers is at risk of disappearing. This study aimed at mapping the knowledge on roots and tubers and assessing the role of
 roots and tubers in household food security among 15 ethno-linguistic indigenous groups in the Philippines. As part of the study, secondary data analysis, key informant interviews,
 focus-group discussion, field visits, administered tests and validation follow-ups were conducted. More than 20 roots and tubers consisting of 10 cultivated species and more than
 10 species of wild roots and tubers were identified. The first include cassava, sweet potato, greater yam, taro, tannia, lesser yam, arrowroot, potato, yacon and yam bean, the second
 nami, elephant yam, giant taro, canna, wild yam bean and wild species of taro, greater yam and lesser yam. Among the indigenous people, the roots and tubers are not only used for
 meeting household food needs, but are also traded, used for medicinal purposes and as gifts and offerings. In the eyes of the people, root and tuber crops farming inculcates the virtues
 of industriousness and self-reliance. Unfortunately, only those born before the 1980‚Äôs retain traditional knowledge pertaining to the diversity and variety of roots and tubers, cropping

Quantitative Literacy and Reasoning of Freshman Students with Different Academic Background Pursuing STEM-related Programs,"Sibaen, Nick W.","This paper investigates the quantitative literacy and reasoning (QLR) of freshmen students pursuing a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)‚Äìrelated degree but do not necessarily have a Senior High School (SHS) STEM background. QLR is described as a multi-faceted skill focused on the application of Mathematics and Statistics rather than just a mere mastery of the content domains of these fields. This article compares the QLR performance between STEM and non-STEM SHS graduates. Further, this quantitative-correlational study involves 255 freshman students, of which 115 have non-STEM academic background from the SHS. Results reveal that students with a SHS STEM background had significantly higher QLR performance. Nevertheless, this difference does not cloud the fact that their overall QLR performance marks the lowest when compared to results of similar studies. This paper also shows whether achievement in SHS courses such as General Mathematics, and Statistics and Probability are significant predictors of QLR. Multivariate regression analysis discloses that achievement in the latter significantly relates to QLR. However, the low coefficient of determination (10.30%) suggests that achievement in these courses alone does not account to the students‚Äô QLR. As supported by a deeper investigation of the students‚Äô answers, it is concluded that QLR indeed involves complex processes and is more than just being proficient in Mathematics and Statistics.",BSU,Main

Its objectives are to determine how physics teachers describe computer simulations based on how they are used, how these are embedded in the teaching-learning process, their impact on the teaching-learning process, and the challenges of integrating these into physics teaching. Using the phenomenological design, two themes emerged for the first objectives, which are process-based and system-based. First, the teacher-manipulated with sub-themes of engaging, demonstrating, elaborating, and evaluating, and student-manipulated emerged on how the simulations are used. Second, the impact to teaching generated knowledge-based, skill-based, and value-based learning-based primarily on the three learning domains.

"""Concern for Community"": Case of cooperatives in the Cordillera Region","Launio, Cheryll C.;Sotelo, Marycris","One area where cooperatives supposedly differ from corporate capitalism is their higher level of concern for the community beyond its membership base. ICA seventh principle is thus ‚Äúconcern for community.‚Äù Philippine cooperative law mandates cooperatives to allot at least three percent of their yearly net surplus for community development funds (CDF). This study presents how cooperatives build and use their CDF and determine their constraints in conducting community projects. It used data from a mailed survey and annual performance reports. Findings indicate high compliance in allocating for CDF but a relatively low actual utilization rate, especially among small cooperatives. Actual CDF spending is highly positively associated with total assets, net surplus, cooperative size, and the total number of cooperative members. Common projects implemented are mostly in the area of education, health, and the environment. Perceived challenges in implementing community development projects include limited funds, lack of member-participation, poor coordination with partner organizations, and lack of a concrete plan for using CDF. The study recommends strengthened support for cooperatives to plan for intentional CDF use through capacity building on project planning and management, more functional monitoring and evaluation of development plans, and social audit reports, and further impact research.",BSU,La Trinidad

Library Usage by Faculty Members of Benguet State University,"Cabfilan, Noel W.;Ricardo, Marjorie C.","The study's objectives were to determine Benguet State University faculty members' general impression of the library resources and their usage of these resources. To answer these objectives, questions on faculty members' satisfaction with the library resources, frequency of usage, purposes of using the library resources, reasons for not using the library resources, reasons of not being able to find the resources they are looking for in the library and suggestions for library development in terms of library resources were asked.
 It was found out that the majority of the faculty members have used the library resources at least once-a-term. On the other hand, those who did not use the library resources cited the Internet as the source of their information needs. Faculty members often used library resources for instructional support purposes, and book collections to be the most used library resources. Faculty members said that they partly found the library resources they were looking for during their last visit to the library. Furthermore, they also said that usually they rarely saw the library resources that they were looking for. They specified that the University Library has no resource/s on a particular subject because they could not find or get the resources they need.
 Moreover, faculty members would like to have more Internet access (Terminals/Wi-Fi) in the library. In terms of subject coverage, faculty members would like the Serials resources to be improved the most. Faculty members rated the library resources from Average to Good in terms of Recency, Relevance/Use, and Adequacy. Except for Optical Discs, which was rated Fair for its Adequacy.

Factors Influencing Mathematics Teaching as a Career Choice (FIMT-Choice): An Instrument Development and Validation,"Madinno, Carmelo W.","The study developed and validated an instrument that assess the motivations of secondary mathematics pre-service teachers (SMPTs) in choosing mathematics teaching as their career, hereto referred as Factors Influencing Mathematics Teaching as a Career Choice (FIMT-Choice). The study adopted items from Factors Influencing Teaching as a Career Choice (FIT-Choice) instrument by Watt and Richardson and calibrated or added items suited to the local area. The notion that content mathematics could be among the motivations of secondary pre-service teachers in choosing math-teaching career was also considered. The study generated 56 final items in the FIMT- Choice instrument, which were validated among 171 secondary mathematics pre-service teachers (SMPTs) in two prominent teacher education institutions in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Philippines. Statistical tools such as Cronbach‚Äôs Alpha, Bartlett's Test of Sphericity, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy and the Principal Component Factor Analysis were used to establish the reliability and validity of the instrument. The results suggest that the SMPTs consider 10 valid and reliable constructs in choosing mathematics teaching as their career. Particularly, the SMPTs separate the mathematics, the teaching, and the combined mathematics teaching aspects in their motivations in entering the mathematics-teaching career. Thus, the FIMT-Choice Scale assess more specific areas of motivations in choosing mathematic- teaching as a career among SMPTs compared with the FIT-Choice Scale by Watt and Richardson. Hence, the FIMT- Choice Scale is a more precise instrument in exploring the motivations of SMPTs in entering the methematics teaching career.",BSU,Main
Exploring the Gap Between Framework and Practice: A Student-Teaching Experience of the Secondary Mathematics Pre-service Teachers,"Madinno, Carmelo W.","Educators and researchers stress the importance of student teaching in teacher preparation since the pre-service teachers are given the opportunity and the challenge to put into practice the different concepts and theories they acquired from their academic courses under the guidance of a professional teacher. The study was conducted to assess the student teaching experiences of the secondary mathematics pre-service teachers (SMPTs). The study used an explanatory design model, which is a mixture of quantitative and qualitative approaches. The quantitative approach involved the analysis of the actual teaching ratings and comments/suggestions given by the mentoring teachers of the SMPTs, while the qualitative approach involved the conduct of a one-on-one interview to purposively chosen participants to support the quantitative results. The study involved 73 graduating SMPTs from seven selected public and private Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs) in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). The results indicate the strengths of the SMPTs as well as their shortcomings and challenges during their student-teaching experience. For instance, classroom management, teaching without the supervision of a cooperating teacher and impromptu teaching were among the problems that emerged in the duration of their student- teaching. These results are important in the improvement of the secondary mathematics teachers' preparation program, particularly in their student teaching experience.",BSU,Main
"Effect of teacher-made narrative fiction (TMNF) about covalent bonding on students‚Äô achievement, retention, and interest","Wadasen, R. F.;Lubrica, J.V.","To investigate how science narratives affect learning in Grade 9 Chemistry, specifically on covalent bonding, the authors developed a science narrative fiction. Subsequently, this teacher-made narrative fiction (TMNF) was utilized in order to determine its influence on the achievement, retention and interest levels toward covalent bonding and toward Chemistry, in general. A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design was utilized. Results showed that the students exposure to the TMNF can increase levels of achievement, retention and interest in learning covalent bonding and towards Chemistry. They also showed that students have a positive perception toward TMNF. It can be concluded that students can benefit from being exposed to TMNF along achievement, retention, and interest levels; and that, the positive perception of the students is indicative of their enthusiasm towards the use of it. TMNF may be adapted in the classroom together with expository texts and other relevant teaching-learning strategies. School heads and administrators may empower science teachers to create their own narratives by providing an avenue for professional development in line with narrative writing which can lead to the creation of a shared resource for the teaching-learning community.",BSU,Main

Knowledge Construction Schemata of Teachers in Solving Real World Non-Routine Problem Situation: Their Implications to Mathematics Education,"Oryan, Serano L.","The study investigated the nature of Knowledge Construction Schemata (KCS) that teacher-solvers use to solve a real-world non-routine problem situation. Eighteen Math teachers in different schools of Region I and the Cordillera Administrative Region were given a carefully selected power problem, which they solved in at most two hours. Results showed that rigid procedural framework of thought characterizes respondents‚Äô KCS in solving problems. Based on this framework, solvers see solutions to a problem situation as purely routine or algorithmic procedures, a condition that makes them selective in interpreting data. They give meaning only to quantitative data while ignoring the qualitative ones, resulting in incomplete solution steps and failure to solve the problem. The influence of the routine type of problem solving appears to be so entrenched that solvers could not find meaning in qualitative data and venture to alternative solution steps that do not necessarily address the problem situation. An important component of problem solving, which is making necessary adjustments in response to a new problem situation (accommodation process), remains a great challenge among the teacher-solvers. Their KCS nature is heavily confined to assimilation processes, which seem responsible for keeping solvers from making exploratory attempts that could have paved the way for more productive problem solving. The study recommends that real-world non-routine type of problem-solving be integrated with school mathematics to develop among the students flexible, reflective, and transformational KCS.",BSU,Main

Efficacy of Fermented Garlic and Vinegar-Based Biopesticide for the Management of Sweetpotato Wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Batatas,"Masangcay, Teresita D.;Galian, Jophr L.","This study aimed to determine possible biopesticides against Fusarium wilt in sweetpotato using locally available materials. The fungicidal efficiency of fermented garlic and vinegar combinations were tested against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. batatas through bioassay, as a soil amendment, and as a spray on infected field plants. Three different local kinds of vinegar, namely sweetpotato vinegar, coconut water (sukang puti) and cane vinegar produced comparable inhibition zones in vitro. Garlic and wood vinegar combination produced the least inhibition zone against the fungus but was the most effective soil amendment. Soil with Trichoderma harzianum recorded the highest herbage weight and length but did not translate to storage root yield. Instead, garlic and wood vinegar or sweetpotato vinegar had the highest storage root yield. Its efficacy was comparable with other amendments such as Trichoderma harzianum and lime. The soil amendments enhanced herbage and root yield in the study despite favorable conditions for disease development. When used as a spray, garlic extract combined with either wood vinegar, sweetpotato, coconut water, or cane vinegar was found effective in controlling Fusarium wilt, as verified in two trials giving more than 50% disease control compared to untreated plants. Results showed that fermented garlic, regardless of local vinegar formulation, is an effective biopesticide in managing Fusarium wilt of sweetpotato.",BSU,La Trinidad

"Status of Introduced Potato Varieties in Benguet and Mountain Province, Philippines","Kiswa, Cynthia G.;Dao-Ines, Gabby K.;Gayao, Betty T.","Benguet and Mountain Province are recipients of several potato variety introductions since the 1970s due to its favorable climate to highland crop production. Farmers save planting materials year by year through traditional practices, which led to accumulation of diseases, degeneration, and eventually, loss of varieties. Other reasons for loss of varieties are unavailability of plant materials, susceptibility to diseases, particularly wilts and rots, vulnerability to abiotic stress, and introduction of new varieties. Out of 40 varieties introduced, only 15 varieties are presently cultivated. Only five of these cultivated varieties are most preferred by farmers, namely: Granola, Igorota, Mexican, Fina, and Cosima. However, Fina and Cosima are limited in production due to the unavailability of planting materials.

Gender Roles in Root and Tuber Crops Production in Northern Philippines,"Meldoz, Dalen T.;Gayao, Betty T.;Backian, Grace S.","Literature provides evidence that gender-specific analysis of agricultural production can improve system performance. This study documents and examines the gender division of roles and responsibilities in root and tuber crops production among indigenous peoples in the Northern Philippines using secondary data, focus group discussions with 83 men and 101 women farmers, field visits, and direct observations. The study covered 11 provinces and 13 indigenous communities: Ibalois, Kankana-eys, Applai-Kankana-eys, Kalanguyas, Isnegs, Biga-Kalingas, Masadiit-Tingguians, Iyattukas, Ivatans, Bagos, Bugkalots, Aetas, and Buhid-Mangyans, as well as the Kapampangan and Ilocano rootcrop farmers in Central Luzon. Gender roles and gender division of labor are mostly similar among selected ethnolinguistic groups in different landscapes. Women‚Äôs labor participation with men in land preparation is higher in swidden farming, rainfed sloping field, and dry land, which are unfavorable environments. Men dominate activities that require physical strength such as land preparation, spraying chemicals, and hauling of inputs and harvested crops. Women in subsistence and small farms participate more in field activities. Also, in indigenous groups, women are traditionally exposed to physical labor compared with those in irrigated areas, wherein the farming households are better off. Results also revealed that men dominate crop maintenance in commercial production of rootcrops among Kapampangans and Ilocanos, but not for Benguet wherein both men and women almost equally execute potato production activities. Findings imply that policy and development workers can capitalize on the active indigenous women labor participation in matters related to root and tuber crops production as a strategy for food security.",BSU,La Trinidad

This study assessed the capacity of 26 La Trinidad farmers on using social media to promote their farms as agri-tourism sites. The study employed the Participatory Communication Research Action (PCRA) Model. Results from community consultations, ocular surveys, key informant interviews, and document reviews revealed that the study areas have natural characteristics and enough resources to support agri-tourism. However, the farmers needed further assistance in addressing the issues that come with these characteristics and resources. The assessment test showed that the respondents have a moderate level of social media marketing (SMM) skills, knowledge, and traits. Thus, the study conducted a seminar on SMM where the participants were guided to develop SMM plans for their own farms. Additionally, the study was able to assess the PCRA Model and found it to be far more flexible than originally thought. Thus, the study crafted a more coherent PCRA model, namely the Model of Participatory Communication towards Self-management, from combining the lessons learned from this study and the strength of Dance‚Äôs Helix Model of communication. The study recommends that government or non-government extension efforts may look into further addressing the needed additional SMM knowledge, skills, and traits of the respondents as well as possible capacity building activities on product development. Future studies could look into the progress of the SMM plans developed by the respondents to find out how the respondents could be further assisted",BSU,La Trinidad
Implementation of Inclusive Education in the Cordillera Administrative Region,"Miguel, Dante M.","Inclusive education promotes education for all. An inclusive school is thus where all types of learners can participate and be treated equally. This study focused on the implementation of inclusive education in selected schools in the Cordillera Administrative Region. It involved the profile of Children with Special Learning Needs (CSLN); problem behaviors of children; behavior modification techniques, accommodations, and teaching adjustments applied by teachers. The study was conducted in six inclusive schools from three divisions: Baguio City, Benguet, and Mt. Province during the school year 2012-2013. Descriptive research design was employed in which direct class observations, interviews and survey questionnaires were used to gather data. Findings showed that there was a total of 20 CSLN enrolled in the selected inclusive schools. The children had varied cases like intellectual disability, sensory impairments and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Problem behaviors displayed by the CSLN were dealt with by teachers using behavior modification techniques, accommodations, and teaching adjustments. The study likewise showed that most CSLN in the regular schools have mild to moderate cases. The challenging behaviors observed among the CSLN were very much different from those being displayed by regular students, hence, the frequency of applying BMTs, accommodation, modification, and adjustment to the former was slightly higher. A training proposal for inclusive teachers was designed as a result of the study.",BSU,La Trinidad
"Multi-Grade Intermediate Mathematics Teaching Schemes: The Case of Education in the District of Tublay, Benguet","Belleza, Jorenz A;Feliciano, Esper L.","Multi-grade is a teaching approach that requires systematic processes to cater to the needs of the learners. The Philippine Department of Education came up with multi-grade teaching schemes to provide teachers with choices to systematically handle the uncommon situation in their classrooms. The study was conducted to determine the knowledge and application of intermediate multi-grade teachers of the different multi-grade teaching schemes in teaching mathematics in the District of Tublay, Benguet. The findings revealed that the scheme choice of the teachers in teaching mathematics is determined by the uncommon objectives and learning competencies of mathematics in different grade levels in a certain grading period. In addition, the claim of the teachers that they are using locally modified scheme, Benguet Scheme D, in teaching intermediate mathematics is mainly backed by the fact that teachers are developing uncommon learning competencies for the combined grade level. However, varied deviations in the implementation processes of the scheme used by the multi-grade teachers in teaching intermediate mathematics were observed even when the same scheme elements were used since they claim to use Benguet Scheme D. The effectiveness of the schemes was tied by the teachers to time efficiency and level appropriate activities.",BSU,La Trinidad
Training Design Facilitation Framework for Adult Education: An Application of Andragogy,"Aliping, Joanne B.;Parcasio, Imelda G.","This qualitative research generally aimed to develop a training design facilitation framework suitable for adult education. Thus, the study used ‚Äòbetween-method triangulation‚Äô in gathering data. With this, qualitative corpus analysis (document reviews), participant observation (field observations), and phenomenology (focus group and key informant interviews) were utilized in obtaining the best practices employed when designing learning programs and facilitating adult education. Through sorting, categorization, and thematization, the study addressed three major themes namely, ‚ÄúEmployed Andragogical Training Design Procedures: Designing Learning Programs;‚Äù ‚ÄúDemonstrated Andragogical Facilitation Practices and Approaches: Implementing Learning Programs;‚Äù and, ‚ÄúDevised Andragogical Training Design Facilitation Framework: Operationalization.‚Äù The result of the study posits that the success of learning lies on the extent of involvement of adult learners in the overall learning process. With this finding, the study arrived at an adult learner-centered framework hereto referred as 4Ds (Diagnose, Design, Deliver, and Deduce). This capitalizes on various processes guiding adult educators in training design making and facilitating adult learning. Specifically, the framework advocates a ‚Äòlearner-diagnosed needs‚Äô or objectives through the Learning Needs Assessment and Analysis (LNA2) process, a ‚Äòlearner-designed instruction‚Äô through the Session Plan Design (SPD) process, an ‚Äòandragogy-based delivery or facilitation‚Äô through the WP2R2 approach, and a ‚Äòlearner-deduced evaluation of materials and outcomes‚Äô through the Post-Learning Evaluation (PLE) process.",BSU,La Trinidad
Five-year Performance of the Teacher Education Graduates in the Licensure Examination for Teachers,"Botengan, Desiree F.;Bansiong, Apler J.;Kudan, Rosita B.","The study analyzed the five-year performance ratings of the Bachelor in Elementary Education (BEE) and Bachelor in Secondary Education (BSE) graduates of Benguet State University‚ÄìCollege of Teacher Education (BSU-CTE) in the Licensure Examinations for Teachers (LET). Using descriptive research design involving document analysis, the results of nine LET examinations from April 2010 to March 2015 were analyzed. Findings revealed that the accumulated performance ratings of the BEE and BSE graduates were high. The general ratings were platykurtic and negatively skewed. The performance ratings in the August/September schedules were significantly higher than in the March/April examinations. Further, the college performance ratings surpassed the national passing rate. In all nine examinations, the first-time takers and the fresh graduates had consistently outperformed the repeaters and old graduate takers. The Early Childhood Education (BEE-ECED) and the Biological Sciences (BSE-Bio. Sci.) graduates registered higher passing rates. Percentage passing rates were highest in the Professional Education area and lowest in the field of specialization. Across all areas and degrees, the performance ratings of BSU-CTE graduates appeared to be influenced by the number of takes, time of examination, and specialization.",BSU,La Trinidad
Teaching Strategy to Enhance Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Instructional Skills,"Yango, Divina M.","The progression of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) use has kindled new ways of learning. Effectiveness of new strategies of learning needs to be scientifically tested to assure their efficacy in instruction. The study aimed to look into the influence of blended learning environment on the pre-service teachers‚Äô ICT instructional skills. Respondents of the study were pre-service teachers enrolled in Benguet State University. The study employed the static pretest-posttest control group experimental research design. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to treat the data. Research findings revealed that pre-service teachers‚Äô performance before and after the conduct of face-to-face and blended modes of learning exhibited substantial increase in their learning. Exceedingly high learning result along use of blended mode were disclosed along technology literacy, knowledge deepening, knowledge creation, use of ICT to introduce new lessons and use of ICT to extend learning. Similarly, comparable learning results along face-to-face mode of learning were noted along technology literacy, knowledge deepening, knowledge creation, use of ICT to introduce new lessons, reinforce learning, and use of ICT to supplement knowledge. The use of both face-to-face and blended modes of learning led to significant acceleration of ICT skills development of pre-service teachers. Learning gains between blended learning and face-to-face modes learning are comparable. They are likewise complementary in developing the pre-service teachers‚Äô ICT instructional skills",BSU,La Trinidad
"School-Based Management in Benguet, Philippines","Lubrica, Percyveranda A.;Parcasio, Imelda G.;Cuevas, Jingle P.;Alvaro, Manolita N.;Gallardo, Alma Vida G.;Batani, Ruth S.","Experts agree that there is a need for continuous evaluation and upgrading for school-based management (SMB) to be fully realized. In the Philippines, there had been few attempts at the national level but in-depth, localized evaluation is being recommended. Hence, this study was conceptualized to document and determine the effect of SMB on the school heads‚Äô governance of secondary school in Benguet, Philippines. The study employed both quantitative method (structured survey) and qualitative method (focused group discussion and interviews). Results showed that the use of SMB by school heads is a key factor in effectively running the school system. Manifestations of these are observed in the very satisfactory application of the SMB knowledge and skills in school governance with minimal support and guidance from their superiors. In addition, the school heads‚Äô extent of application of the acquired SBM knowledge and skills have influenced their capability in school governance. However, the school heads expressed developmental needs to further their management skills. Such results imply a substantial realization on the implementation of SMB in secondary schools embarking on institutionalizing quality improvement measures in all program areas as mandated in their respective school systems",BSU,La Trinidad
Teaching Practices for Children with Autism (CWA) at Baguio SPED Center,"Miguel, Dante M.","With the increasing number of children with Autism (CWA) in the Philippines, this study looked at the teaching practices in a multi-awarded Special Education Center. It documented the CWAs‚Äô challenging behaviors, practices applied by SPED teachers in dealing with the challenging behaviors, and the effectiveness of such practices using mixed method of research. Findings show that the challenging behaviors of CWAs are aggressiveness, defiance, hyperactivity, motor deficiencies, self-stimulatory, speech deficiencies, and tantrums. The practices applied by the SPED teachers include Behavior Modification Techniques (BMTs), classroom set-ups, and schedule modifications. The study concludes that CWAs display certain types of challenging behavior different from each other. Most of these challenging behaviors occur very often that SPED teachers have to apply various practices repeatedly. However, applying a particular practice should be based upon the cause of the behavior, the CWA‚Äôs reaction, and the perceived effectiveness of the practice. This study recommends that using a certain practice for a particular type of challenging behavior, as documented in this study, be considered by other SPED Centers and regular school teachers handling inclusive education classes. Further, it recommends incorporating these practices and their appropriate application in in-service and continuing education training curriculums.",BSU,La Trinidad
Readiness of Benguet State University Pre-service Teachers in the 21st Century Teaching Environment,"Parcasio, Imelda G.","This study looked into the Benguet State University pre-service teachers‚Äô readiness in the 21st century teaching environment as evaluated by their respective Cooperating Teachers during their off-campus student teaching. It is a descriptive quantitative study conducted in Baguio and Benguet with 130 teacher-respondents from 14 Cooperating Schools of BSU College of Teacher Education. Based on the concept of eight 21st century skills, the cooperating teachers observed and evaluated the pre-service teachers as very good adaptors because of their ability to be flexible in teaching and learning at the same time; visionaries because they are open to suggestions and criticisms; collaborators because they have the skills in facilitating curricular instructions with the aid of technology, and risk takers as they accept criticisms to enhance instruction. On the other hand, the pre-service teachers need enhancements in the other skills like learning, communicating, role modeling and leading. The challenges faced by the cooperating teachers in guiding the pre-service teachers are: mentoring on ICT utilization, improvement of communication skills, lack of time for one-on-one coaching, the inability of pre-service teachers to meet the deadline of requirements, and the missing of reminders to instructions given to them by the cooperating teachers.",BSU,La Trinidad
Teachers‚Äô Preparedness for Inclusive Education,"Sito, Leonila R.","The Commission of Higher Education mandates all Teacher Training Institutions in the Philippines to offer a professional course on inclusive education starting school year 2018-2019. The study determined the level of preparedness of the Benguet State University Teacher Education faculty members to teach the said course. Specifically, it determined their familiarity with the principles that underpin inclusive education, skill in managing inclusive classes, and attitudes towards inclusion. Comparisons on these three main variables were made in terms of the level that they taught, years in the teaching service, and whether they had orientation on inclusive education or none. Two factors related to familiarity with inclusion principles were identified - decision-making with learners and stakeholders' active involvement. The teachers were moderately familiar with both principles but were significantly more familiar with the principles related to stakeholder‚Äôs active involvement. Significant differences were observed on familiarity when involving stakeholders according to level taught and years in service. Respondents with or without orientation on inclusive education had comparable levels of familiarity with the inclusion principles. The teachers were moderately efficacious in enhancing learning, classroom management, and establishing relationships. They had a significantly higher level of efficacy on classroom management than on enhancing learning and establishing partnerships. Significant differences were observed in the efficacy levels according to level taught and years of service but none in terms of attendance to orientation for inclusion. Two factors related to agreeing towards inclusion attitudes were identified: improvement for successful inclusion and mainstreaming. The agreement level for attitudes toward self-improvement is significantly greater than attitude toward mainstreaming in inclusive education. Significant differences in attitudes on self-improvement were found along the level taught and years in service. The findings have implications for an improved training level for both in-service and pre-service teachers, policy on all tertiary level programs, and consciousness-raising about diversity to the larger society.",BSU,La Trinidad
Motivation Toward Teaching and Employment Profile of the Bachelor of Secondary Education Graduates of Benguet State University,"Bansiong, Apler J.;Alawas, Dolores E.;Bokilis, Almon B.;Cuevas, Jingle P.;Dolendo, Russell B.;Parcasio, Imelda G.","This study determined the graduates‚Äô reasons for pursuing secondary education, employment profiles, and job-search strategies and challenges. Data were collected from 602 Bachelor of Secondary Education graduates in the AY 2013-2017 at Benguet State University. The College of Teacher Education Graduate Tracer Questionnaire (CGTQ) was used to gather data. Findings showed that about half of the respondents personally chose the degree, indicating their intrinsic motivation towards secondary school teaching. This trend was consistent across most specializations. Moreover, about 90% of the graduates traced are gainfully employed, mostly as classroom teachers (65%). Very few are unemployed (3%) and self-employed (6%). About 70% of the graduates hold non-permanent status and are employed in the private sector (about 60%). Most of the graduates are employed a year after graduation, and their mode salaries range from Php5, 000.00 to Php15, 000.00. Only status of employment was influenced by their level of motivation towards teaching. Many of the graduates were able to find a job through their friends or relatives. Finally, the most important hindrances encountered by the graduates in their job search are the absence of or inadequacy of experience and the lack of jobs related to their degree or field of specialization.",BSU,La Trinidad
Teaching Internship Apprehensions of Pre-service Teachers,"Bansiong, Apler J.","This paper determined the level of teaching internship apprehensions (TIAs) of elementary and secondary pre-service teachers (PSTs) in a capital town campus of a State University in the Cordillera Administrative Region. The PSTs‚Äô overall TIAs were compared according to degree program, sex, and specialization. It also identified the specific sources of TIAs that are most and least pressing to the respondents. An adapted version of the Teaching Internship Apprehensions Scale (TIAS) was used to gather data. Results showed that overall, the PSTs were highly anxious about the off-campus teaching internship, as indicated by their high overall level of TIAs. The Bachelor in Elementary Education (BEE) PSTs and the female participants possessed significantly higher TIAs than their counterparts. However, specialization appeared a non-significant determinant of TIA levels in both degree programs. The greatest sources of TIA were learner-related factors and the teaching process. Specifically, the PSTs were most concerned about pupil control and classroom management, adapting to the learners‚Äô individual needs and interests, motivating learners, selecting appropriate strategies, and lesson planning. In contrast, the PSTs were least concerned about their self-confidence, background knowledge, and ability to adapt to limited resources.

"Effects of extreme weather events and coping mechanisms of smallholder highland farmers: The case of Typhoon Ompong in Benguet, Philippines","Launio, Cheryll C.","There is limited published literature on the effects of and coping mechanisms on extreme weather events for vegetable farmers and traders in the mountainous region. This study uses survey and key informant interviews to determine the effects of Typhoon Ompong on farm households, their recovery period, and coping mechanisms. The consequences for smallholder farmers of Typhoon Ompong were damaged standing crops, erosion or run-off on farms and the closure of farm-to-market and national roads connecting farms to wholesale markets. Most farmers recovered their losses within six to eight months, but the mean was 13 months from the typhoon. Most farm households heeded the early warning of the impending storm by securing their farm and house, storing food, and harvesting standing crops or transporting harvested crops to trading areas. After the event, planting again or changing crops and saving and marketing the remaining crop are their only options. Community cooperation was automatic in terms of the cleaning and repair of roads and water sources. The study recommends strengthening forecasts and forecast dissemination of continuous heavy rainfall, provision of accurate and real-time information on road condition, increased local R&D on erosion and road landslide forecasting, ensuring the availability of ready-to-plant seeds and seedlings after extreme weather events, and capitalizing on the traditional ‚Äúadduyon‚Äù for disaster management.",BSU,La Trinidad
"Local Knowledge on climate hazards, weather forecasts and adaptation strategies: The case of Cool Highlands in Benguet, Philippines","Launio, Cheryll C.;Batani, Ruth S.;Galagal, Christita P.;Labon, Kacy O.","Local knowledge that includes traditional and indigenous knowledge can inform response strategies and strengthen the resilience of communities. Benguet Province, known for its contribution to highland horticulture production in the country, has been ranked second in the Philippines in terms of climate change vulnerability. This study aimed to understand local knowledge in Benguet on the various climate hazards, on climate and weather forecasting information, and analyze local adaptation strategies. The findings indicate that smallholder farmers in Benguet have a rich local knowledge in terms of the hazards that mainly affect their agricultural production, namely typhoons, prolonged monsoon rains, frosts, hailstorms, erosion and landslides. They also have traditional weather and climate indicators or some form of climate and weather information that span the 12-month calendar. Their local adaptation strategies mostly stem from their hard work and pragmatic attitude. Recommendations include R&D on tolerance to frost by growth stage for major highland crops, and techniques for crop scheduling to achieve optimum yield; more active information dissemination on the 10-day duration and monthly weather forecasts, as well as wind direction advisories; increased R&D for forecasting continuous heavy rains; and comparison of traditional knowledge-based predictions with scientific information for possible integration.",BSU,La Trinidad
Interactive Physics Apparatus: Influence on interest of secondary school students in pursuing a career path in STEM,"Lubrica, Joel V.;Dolipas, Bretel B.;Ramos, Jennifer Lyn S.;Abiasen, Jovalson T.","In this article, we present results of our endeavours as physics educators to facilitate and support pedagogical change and development in the educational system of a developing country, the Philippines. We have discovered that the interaction of junior high school (years 7‚Äì10) students with physics apparatus can influence students' interest in pursuing a career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This assertion stems from self-reports of students who gave their views immediately after their exposure to interactive apparatus in their own school, outside of their usual lessons. Participants claimed that their interest in following a STEM career path was' greatly increased'due to their exposure to these apparatus. This was true even for students who were intending to take a non-STEM career path.",BSU,Main
Adoption and economic analysis of using biological control in Philippine highland farms: Case of Trichoderma koningii strain KA,"Launio, Cheryll C.;Labon, Kacy O.;Ba√±ez, Alladin A.;Batani, Ruth S.","This study summarized evidence of adoption and outcomes of using Trichoderma koningii in highland agriculture in the Philippines, and estimated economic rate of returns to T. koningii R&D. Adoption rates were estimated from sales data of T. koningii pure culture, and net incremental changes based on reviewed field experiments in the Cordillera region, Philippines and partial budget analysis based on farmer interviews. Findings showed that T. koningii are being used mostly by organic and good agricultural practice producers as biofungicide for disease management, and as soil nutrient and compost enhancer. T. koningii pure culture annual geometric growth rate of sales was at 29.7% and overall adoption rate in Benguet in 2018 was roughly estimated at 0.03%. Identified constraints to adoption are: high price; misconception that Trichoderma is for organic farmers only; slow effect of the technology; limited information; and limited market outlets and marketing strategies. The estimated change in yield due to use of T. koningii ranged from 10% to 50% based on farmer interviews, and 4%‚Äì92% based on field and pot experiments in various crops and uses from literature. The net present value (NPV) assuming a 10% real social discount rate is PhP4.3 M (USD0.08M), and the rate of returns for the Philippine government investing resources in T. koningii development and promotion was estimated at 49.1% considering a 10-year period. Assuming the lowest estimate of net benefit at PhP28670 ha-1 (547 USD ha‚àí1) and 20 years project duration, the NPV is Php3.7 M (USD 0.07M).

Bodily Flactuating Asymmetry and Academic Performance in Physics and Mathematics,"Dolipas, Bretel B.","The study intended to determine the bodily FA of students when grouped according to gender; and to determine if bodily FA is related to physics performance and mathematics performance of students when grouped according to gender. 
 Result of study shows that most of the female students have bodily FA ranging from -0.10 to 0.09. This is also observed for the males. There is a significant difference in the bodily FA of female students to zero mean. This implies that female students have varying left-right body dimensions . For male students, the bodily FA do not differ significantly with the population mean size differences of zero. This implies that male students have a bodily FA but the left-right dimensions do not differ significantly. Also bodily FA of male students differ significantly with that of the female students. 
 The performance in mathematics of female students is significantly related to their bodily FA. This is not observed though with the male students. The bodily FA of students as a whole is significantly related to their performance in mathematics. The higher the bodily FA the lower the performance of students in mathematics. 
 In physics, the bodily FA of student male or female is not significantly related to the performance in physics. Overall the bodily FA of student male or female is not significantly related to the performance in physics.",BSU,Main
Influences of College Grade Point Average on Librarians‚Äô Licensure Examination Performance,"Bansiong, Apler J.;Lascano, Elizabeth A.","This study analyzed the degree of influence of college grade point average (GPA) on Librarians‚Äô Licensure Examination (LLE) performance. The case group was the Bachelor of Library and Information Science (BLIS) graduates in a state-run University in Benguet, Philippines. The results of the 2015 and 2016 LLEs were analyzed in this study. Document analysis and correlation were the mean research methods used. Results revealed that the overall GPAs of the two batches of BLIS graduates were high. These high GPAs, however, did not translate well with their LLE ratings, which is fair. On the average, overall college GPA did not contribute much to the graduates‚Äô LLE ratings (r2 = 33%). Also, the influence to the LLE ratings of all LLE courses combined (r2 = 26%) and LIS core courses (r2 = 39%) are relatively lower. However, the influence of each individual LLE area when taken individually is higher, with r2 values ranging from 41% (Information Technology) to 66% (Cataloging and Classification). Interestingly, GPAs in Cataloging and Classification had consistently exerted a high influence on the BLIS graduates‚Äô LLE ratings. Meanwhile, their GPA in general education subjects had a substantial contribution (r2 = 45%) to their LLE ratings. Finally, when GPAs in the six LLE areas grades were correlated with their specific ratings in these areas in the LLE, weaker degree of associations were noted.",BSU,La Trinidad
"Factors Influencing Adoption of Selected Peanut Protection and Production Technologies in Northern Luzon, Philippines","Launio, Cheryll C.;Luis, Janet S.;Angeles, Yolanda B.","The peanut is the world's second most important legume, and peanut and peanut-based products have a large potential in the Philippines and other tropical developing countries both in terms of import substitution and export promotion. This study used survey data to describe the socioeconomic and technological level of peanut farmers in major peanut-producing areas in the country, and determine the adoption factors and constraints for selected technologies. A total of 296 farmers in 10 provinces were interviewed in 2015. The binary logit model was applied to explore the farm-level factors affecting the adoption of selected technologies (seed inoculant, seed treatment, chemical fertilizer and pesticides) for peanut farming. Results indicate that decision factors vary per technology but relatively consistent drivers to technology adoption are farmer gender, attendance to seminar or training in peanut production, availability of irrigation source, and membership in organization. Household size was an adoption constraint in select technologies. Technology uptake was also influenced by regional differences. Implications are increased provision of seminars and trainings for peanut farmers; facilitation of farmers' organizations; support by local government units (LGUs) in technology promotion, and ensuring adequate irrigation. Informing decision makers on the factors and constraints to adoption of these technologies will largely make for evidence-based policymaking. The adoption of the selected technologies covered in this study will not only improve farmers' yield and income, but may eventually contribute to lower production cost per unit and lower prices in the long run, which has implications to the whole value-chain of peanut and peanut-based products.",BSU,La Trinidad
Entry-to-Exit Academic Variables as Predictors of Board Licensure Examination for Professional Teachers (BLEPT) Ratings,"Bansiong, Apler J.","This study analyzed the entry-to-exit academic profiles and licensure ratings of teacher education graduates in a state university in the Cordillera Administrative Region in three academic years from 2014 to 2016. It also explored which of these academic variables can predict the graduates‚Äô ratings in the Board Licensure Examination for Professional Teachers (BLEPT). The entry variables were high school grade point average (HSGPA), Intelligence Quotient (IQ), and general scholastic aptitude (GSA). College performance included overall and subject GPAs, while exit performance was the scores in the competency appraisal summative test (CAST). Results showed that the teacher education graduates entry-toexit profiles range from satisfactory to very satisfactory. Their licensure ratings were within average. As to the relationship among the variables and BLEPT ratings, the exit variable (CAST scores) and entry variable GSA entered as significant predictors of ratings of the graduates from both degrees. Professional education (Prof.Ed.) and general education (Gen. Ed.) GPAs emerged separately as significant BLEPT rating predictors of the elementary education graduates. Meanwhile, the BLEPT ratings of secondary education graduates were predicted by either their Prof.Ed. GPAs, or their college GPAs, with the addition of their IQ scores.

Analysis of the level of inquiry in the undergraduate science education laboratory,"Bansiong, Apler J.","A common goal for science educators is to engage students in inquiry. Policy makers present inquiry as a continuum and several researchers extrapolate that this continuum is represented by a figure that moves from more to less guidance. Thus inquiry activities are labeled from more structure (low - level inquiry) to less structure (high - level inquiry). This study characterized the level of inquiry in the undergraduate science education laboratory in a State University in the Cordillera Administrative Region. The implication of the result to the preparation of teachers in the K ‚Äì 12 levels was also discussed. Ten laboratory manuals in three fields of science were analyzed. All of these manuals are utilized by science education majors. From these ten laboratory manuals, 147 exercises or activities were evaluated. Each of the laboratory activities was rated from level 1 ‚Äì confirmatory, level 2 ‚Äì structured inquiry, level 3 ‚Äì guided inquiry, level 4 ‚Äì open inquiry, and level 5 ‚Äì authentic inquiry. The ratings made were compared with those of two other evaluators and the inter-rater reliability index was determined. Results showed that majority of the exercises are confirmatory in nature. Very few (less than 10%) of the exercises were higher than the guided inquiry level. There were limited activities involving open inquiry and no exercise involved authentic inquiry. Results indicate that there is a need for professors handling science education majors to focus on less-structured forms of inquiry in their laboratory activities. It is a part of the instructor‚Äôs responsibility to plant the seeds of real inquiry to the minds of future science teachers in order to better prepare them to handle science in the K ‚Äì 12 levels.",BSU,La Trinidad

Butanding in Sorsogon, Kuyug and Tuna in Albay, Sinarapan in Buhi, Cam. Sur, Scallops in Masbate, Pineapple in Daet, Crabs from Catanduanes and Sorsogon, etc. However, most elementary, junior and senior high school students do not know that these resources are abundant and some are only found in their localities and they are not regularly included in elementary, junior and senior high school textbooks and we think are important knowledge or information especially in these years of intellectual development of these children.
 With the rigorous research understandings of Bicol University Tabacco Campus in Fisheries Researchers, many information can be produced and disseminated through alternative and/or additional learning materials. Information on the unique and natural gems of Bicol through seminars, talks, info-visit, enhancement education, etc. can be done to supplement the knowledge elementary, junior ande senior high school student gain from the usual textbooks. It was observed that basic information on our natural resources are not known to them which we think hinders their appreciation to take Fisheries and Fisheries-related courses in the tertiary level. This can be seen by the declining Fisheries student population in all schools in the Philippines. Furthermore, understanding the biology, ecology and economic importance of these natural resources can pique their consciousness which can lead to protection and conservation.
 This extension activity is anchored on the tenet that the best way for children to appreciate the topic is by showing best examples observed in their surroundings. Furthermore, we believe that research outputs can be of optimum utilization and contribution to the community, when they are imparted especially to younger generation. And in Bicol Region, none had been conducted on the utilization of research outputs as teaching materials for elementary, junior and senior high school students - personal interviews with junior and senior high school students among various schools in Bicol revealed their none or low knowledge on the native and unique aquatic gems of Bicol. Which we think is the reason why there is very low motivation for these students to protect and conserve these resources, and more so, to take fisheries and fisheries related courses, with this proposal, we will enhance knowledge and awareness through direct utilization BUTC's research results on native and unique natural gems of Bicol. Thus, this proposal is branded by the project team as ""KADUNUNG BICOL""
 ""DUNONG"" is a Filipino term which means knowledge and wisdom, and in this extension activity, the term KADUNUNG would mean sharing and making them have the same knowledge and wisdom we have in terms of our research information on the natiral germs and processes in Bicol Region.",BU,Tabaco
Electro-Magnetic Induction: Free Electricity Generator,"David, Albert Patrick J.","The study for the search of renewable sources of energy is now a major concern worldwide as replacement to the high demand of fossil fuels. Majority of the electricity that is generated uses the Faraday's law, the electromagnetic induction. This law led to new technologies that even brought up the misconception of free energy. Energy only becomes free if we don't have to pay for the generation of it; hence we resort to abundant sources of energy that we can convert into electricity. The researcher used wind to generate power. It will continuously pass the blades of the fan causing it to rotate. The generator is mounted into a vehicle exposing the blades into turbulent wind, rotating the shaft to generate power and, is extracted and stored into a battery. The process also demonstrates the conversion of kinetic energy from the wind into mechanical power. Results on different settings are compared to identify the best scenario that will generate usable amount of energy and adjustments on the design of the prototype to meet the needs of the end users. The energy generated can be used in numerous applications such as powering and charging mobile devices, powering small light emitting diodes and bulbs. This study focuses on the construction of the generator and evaluating the device to identify its possible applications and future enhancements.

Work Life Balance Of Working Mothers: Phenomenological Inquiry Of Work And Home Lived Experiences,"Hermogenes, Mary Grace G.;Maroma, Dolly;Adriano, Raquel;Morato, Emmanuel","Work-life balance is defined as a satisfactory level of involvement or ‚Äúfit‚Äù between the multiple roles in a person‚Äôs life. It has been a major issue in the lives of working mothers. Several studies had been conducted involving work life balance among working women, but revealed dissimilarities in result. The researcher decided to conduct a study on the lived experiences of working mothers who are college deans at Bulacan State University, knowing the roles these mothers portray in school and at home.
 The researcher made use of qualitative phenomenological research design given the purpose of inquiring on the work and home lived experiences of the working mothers.
 Interview was used extensively on the eight (8) respondents who qualified with the criteria (1) an appointed college dean for academic year 2014-2015 and (2) a working mother. The researcher made use of criterion sampling in choosing the respondents. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed to uncover emerging themes. Next, the most relevant messages were marked and then studied to determine names for emerging themes. A cross-case analysis was conducted studying the portraits and themes in the context of the literature on work-life balance of working mothers. Finally, the real transcript of the lived experiences of the respondents that significantly relate to the themes were highlighted and included in the phenomenological reduction.
 The findings revealed that majority of the working mothers viewed the long hours of work as exhausting, though they are able to adjust to the workload. The many administrative paper works were found stressful and interfere with the quality of work life balance of the respondents. Seven out of eight respondents were not satisfied with the salary and fringe benefits they are getting from the institution.
 The working mother respondents have small family size. They employed househelp or relied on the support of relatives for home care responsibilities. For some, the presence of supportive husbands was a big help.
 The respondents moreover were in agreement that the pressure of work affects the giving of quality time with the family.
 The respondents employed strategies in order to achieve work-life balance. At work, they practiced proper time management. They sought the help of co-workers, like clerk and their assistants whenever there were home activities that coincide with work.
 At home, the deans were lucky to have supportive husbands who attend to family needs whenever they are not available. Others have househelp to assist them in doing household chores. They spare their Sundays for family bonding like attending mass, malling and other form of relaxation.
 Based on the findings, the following propositions were drawn:
 The organization needs to create a culture that values work-life balance. The management may consider implementing a functional work-life strategy program within the organization. Human resource professionals need to put in place work-life friendly policies and programs.
 Based on the findings of the study, the researcher therefore concluded that , work-life balance has been recognized as a critical issue for working mothers at the Bulacan State University. The incompatible demands between the work and family roles have been felt by the respondents.
 The academic pressures of the work environment affected the quality of home life of the respondents.
 Several coping strategies may be employed to address work-life conflicts. Among them were effective time management, proper delegation of responsibilities, creating friendly work environment, sparing time for oneself, and engaging in leisure and relaxation with family.
 There are critical issues in the work place that need to be addressed to achieve the desired work-life balance of the working mothers. Developing a functional work-life program would be a strategic move for competitive advantage of the concerned working mothers.
 The researcher further recommended that the concerned state university creates an organizational culture that promotes work-life balance among the administrators.
 The management needs to implements a functional work-life program that would address the real and perceived overwork and outbalanced pressures of administrators. This would consequently improve the productivity of people in the organization. 
 And lastly, the management and human resource professionals put in place work-life friendly policies and programs that could set the tone for employee engagement.",BulSU,Sarmiento

An Integrated Model To Explain How Intellectual Capital Affects Earnings Quality: Some Evidence From Asian Emerging Economies,"Mutuc, Eugene B.","The importance of intellectual capital (IC) has become visible and increase recognition as a worthy issue in academic and practical investigations. Although IC drives financial performance and competitiveness in the past literature, the quality of financial reporting is one of the essential factors to analyze and examine to achieve IC‚Äôs wholistic impact on company practices. This study integrates the mediating effect of financial performance and industry competition‚Äôs moderating role to explain IC‚Äôs effect on earnings quality (EQ). This study analyzes 1,813 firm-year observations from 2011 to 2017 based on 259 non-financial listed firms from industrials, consumer services, technology, basic materials, consumer goods, utilities, health care, resources, and telecommunications services, based on Thomson Reuters Business Classification (TRBC). The Asian economies, including China, India, Malaysia, South Korea, Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand, were examined to raise a new perspective on the phenomenon and chosen according to the availability of firms‚Äô data at the Thomson Reuters Eikon database. The study employs multivariate regression analyses using SPSS and Baron and Kenny‚Äôs (1986) causal steps approach to test conditional hypotheses. Our main findings reveal that IC investments are essential in creating value for the company and generating better EQ. IC causes better EQ, but the impact is partially mediated by financial performance among the firms from the combined sample (from China, Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand). Moreover, industry competition reinforces a change in the effect of IC on EQ. Specifically, the combined samples and firms from China show that industry competition positively moderates the IC-EQ relationship. In contrast, the Philippines and Thailand firms offer that industry competition negatively moderates the IC-EQ relationship. The control variables, such as financial leverage and size, show mixed findings depending on the analysis context. This study acknowledges that VAIC has limitations as a measure of IC. However, this estimate is considered an appropriate measure of IC because the data needed to calculate VAIC were gathered from audited financial statements (Komnenic & Pokrajƒçiƒá, 2012). This study fills the literature gap through the developed and integrated model to explain the IC-EQ relationship. Future studies may incorporate some more robust consequences and boundary conditions in examining IC‚Äôs impacts on EQ. Lastly, the firm‚Äôs decision-makers should contemplate that IC investments have relevant importance to achieve a competitive advantage and better financial performance. These outcomes are reflected in the means of the quality of financial reports presented by companies",BulSU,Main

Corporate Social Responsibility And Earnings Management: Evidence From Controversial And Non-Controversial Sectors In Asia,"Mutuc, Eugene B.;Lee, Jen-Sin;Tsai, Fu-Sheng","In this study, we investigate the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on earnings management through discretionary
 accruals and real-activities decisions, in light of the increasing attention and engagement of firms from different sectors.
 This study contemplates on non-financial Asian firms from controversial and non-controversial sectors with 889 and 3,017
 firm-year observations from 2011 to 2017. The findings reveal that Asian firms likely use a mix of accrual-based earnings
 management (AEM) and real-activities earnings management (REM) as a strategy to manipulate reported earnings. In
 terms of sector classifications, managers from controversial sectors exhibit higher opportunistic behavior than managers
 from non-controversial sectors regarding accrual-based manipulation. We conjecture that CSR in controversial sectors is
 driven by a high demand for responsibility and actions based on its business operation, a motivation for managers to deceive
 stakeholders and behave opportunistically. In addition, we find that managers of non-controversial sectors are conservative
 in real-activities manipulations. However, CSR of firms from controversial sectors showed to have an insignificant effect on
 this manipulation strategy, consistent with managerial amorality towards real activities decision. Our findings contribute to
 the reconciliation of the impact of building corporate citizenship culture when providing credible financial reports. Lastly, the
 implications for sustainable business operation from the cognizance of controversies in managerial decisions are elaborated.",BulSU,Main

Object Identification And Localization Using Grad-Cam++ With Mask Regional Convolution Neural Network,"Inbaraj, Xavier Alphonse;Villavicencio , Charlyn;Macrohon, Julio Jerison;Jeng, Jyh-Horng;Hsieh, Jjer-Guang","One of the fundamental advancements in the deployment of object detectors in real-time applications is to improve object recognition against obstruction, obscurity, and noises in images. In addition, object detection is a challenging task since it needs the correct detection of objects from images. Semantic segmentation and localization are an important module to recognizing an object in an image. The object localization method (Grad-CAM++) is mostly used by researchers for object localization, which uses the gradient with a convolution layer to build a localization map for important regions on the image. This paper proposes a method called Combined Grad-CAM++ with the Mask Regional Convolution Neural Network (GC-MRCNN) in order to detect objects in the image and also localization. The major advantage of proposed method is that they outperform all the counterpart methods in the domain and can also be used in unsupervised environments. The proposed detector based on GC-MRCNN provides a robust and feasible ability in detecting and classifying objects exist and their shapes in real time. It is found that the proposed method is able to perform highly effectively and efficiently in a wide range of images and provides higher resolution visual representation than existing methods (Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++), which was proven by comparing various algorithms.",BulSU,Main

Predicting Student Program Completion Using Naive Bayes Classification,"Perez, Joann G.;Perez, Eugene S.","Data mining approaches provide different educational institutions opportunities to find hidden patterns from
 the data stored in the database. Many researchers have used these data to develop a model that would assist the institution
 administrators in decision-making. This study was performed to predict student program completion using the Na√Øve
 Bayes classifier technique. The dataset utilized in this study was obtained from Bulacan State University ‚Äì Sarmiento
 Campus in the Philippines under BS Information Technology program from five-year graduates‚Äô data for Academic Year
 2012-2016. This dataset was pre-processed, cleansed, transformed, and balanced before constructing the model. Ten
 predictors were used for predicting student completion. The feature selection technique was used to filter and evaluate the
 significance of each factor. The significant variables assessed by the feature selection technique (Weight by Correlation)
 were the final parameters in creating the model. The Na√Øve Bayes classifier was applied to predict the students‚Äô
 completion using the 70:30 ratios for training and testing dataset distribution. Correlation analysis identified the weight of
 individual attributes to the label attribute. From 10 possible predictor variables, only four (4) predictor variables were
 selected after correlation analysis. The identified significant attributes affecting program completion, namely (in order of
 significance): parents' monthly income, mother and father's educational attainment, and High School GPA attributes. The
 significant attributes identified in correlation analysis splitted into 70% training data or 447 records and 30% testing data
 or 191 records. There were 84 out of 191 data samples, or 44% of students were predicted to complete the program. On the
 other hand, 107 out of 191 data samples, or 56%, were predicted as not completing the program. The accuracy values
 performed an 84% rating with 80.46% class precision, and 83.33% class recall in the testing dataset (n=191). The
 outcomes of this study have a significant impact on HEIs, particularly on college completion rates. This study shall be

Bulacan Landscape Reconstruction: Identifying Natural And Anthropogenic Indicators In Changing Environment,"Larin Jr, Edilberto D.;Mijares, Armand Salvador;Cruz, Jerome;Vanguardia, Susie;Ramos, Rea;Robles, Emil","Cultural landscapes are areas of countryside or land that have been affected, influenced, or shaped by human involvement. A cultural landscape can be associated with a person or event. It can be thousands of acres or a tiny homestead. It can be a grand estate, industrial site, park, garden, cemetery, campus, etc. Collectively, cultural landscapes are works of art, narratives of culture, and expressions of regional identity (Cultural Landscape Foundation, 2016). 
 Sierra Madre is the most significant landscape in the whole island of Luzon. From livelihood to mineral exploration, forest reserved to industrial development, water reserved to transportation network and land conversion this mountain range is connected in almost every aspect of development in the region. The natural resources and geological formation of this mountain range provide not only protection from the storm coming from the Pacific but define cultural diversity and way of life of our nation as a whole.
 
 Archaeologically, Sierra Madre can be considered as the cradle of civilization in the Philippines. The oldest human fossil, MT3, which was found and analysed by professional archaeologist Dr. Armand Salvador Mijares is located in Callao Cave, Penablanca, Cagayan Valley--the extreme northern part of Sierra Madre.
  
 Historically, during the Philippine-American War, caves in Biak na Bato, San Miguel, Bulacan served as command stations of General Emilio Aguinaldo where he initially established the Independent Philippine Government and during WWII, he was humoured to help Capt. Alejo Santos, kept by the Dumagat tribes, to escape from the Japanese forces.
 
 All of this natural resources, cultural diversities and Philippine monumental events for development and nation building in the past and present are all located and happened in Sierra Madre. In this mountain range lies our identity and pride as a Filipino who values his/her prehistory and colonial past that can be used as a foundation of authentic advocacy for heritage protection.",BulSU,Main

It would help the management, administrators and room users to manage the room the correct way. The technology that RFID provides would be exceptional, because RFID does not need a line of sight unlike barcode readers. Compared to barcode readers that only write data, RFID can both read and at the same time write data. RFID are also reusable and they are durable. These are some of the many reasons why people use RFID in the industry and even in the academe. The current system of the College of Information and Communications Technology when it comes to room utilization is still primitive. The college uses the traditional doorknob and key and a logbook for room utilization. Instructors can easily switch rooms even without the permission from the college dean. Monitoring of computer users per room is not fully monitored, as the CCTV located outside the room is not enough to prevent these problems. Along with those problems comes another problem, which is theft. Lots of computer spare parts are stolen. By using a Centralized Room Utilization System using Radio Frequency Identification these problems can be avoided. It is intended for the faculty members, technicians and custodians of CICT. This can secure the safety and monitoring of every computer. It can facilitate the wake up, restart, shutdown, locking and unlocking of computers in using RFID. It can also determine the level of access of users of the room. Room custodians can add and edit the laboratory room schedules. It can determine whom the room users using the RFID card, by this, the system would know what controls are only required to appear for usage. It can also determine and monitor the opened application by the users. Having this, it will be much easier for the instructors/ technician to monitor the user‚Äôs activities.

"Emotional And Social Competence: Their Correlation In The Conversational Skills Of Selected College
 Students","Morata, Emmanuel G.","This study was made to show the significant correlation, whether singly or in combination, of the emotional and social competencies of the selected college students with their conversational skills. The regression and correlation analysis procedures were used to study the relationships between the variables: The student-respondents' emotional and social competencies (independent) and conversational skills (dependent). The regression results revealed that the paralinguistic elements of the conversational skills that included linguistic competence, situational appropriateness, and operational effectiveness had no significant effect on emotional and social competencies that included self-awareness , self-management , and social awareness. However, among all the other subcategories of the independent and dependent variables, the relationship management and non-linguistic elements only were found significantly related to each other. Since the level of relationship management was found to influence the non-linguistic elements of conversation skills significantly, the researcher recommended a program which focused on the relationship management for administrative consideration.",BulSU,Main

Motion Activated Temperature Controlled Electric Fan,"Galita, Warlito;Valerio, Wenceslao","The major objective of the study was to design and develop a motion activated and temperature-controlled electric fan. It is the most practical and affordable way of keeping areas cool especially during hot and humid months. In the Bulacan State University, many electric fans installed in lecture rooms are left unattended even after class hours. This translates to unnecessary fire risks and/or excessive electric consumption of the University. It is in this light that the researchers developed a device that presents an opportunity for the development of intelligent appliances that can save on electricity consumption due to its innovative and eco-friendly features. Various designs were put forward and a careful consideration of each plan was done, with special considerations to the need for innovative appliances that can be very useful in terms of energy efficiency and environment- friendliness through an integrated multi-dimensional sensor system.
 The study utilized the developmental research method in the fabrication of the project. The focus on the procedures and processes involved analysis, development and evaluation of the project and in validating the project. The steps involved in this method include the following: (1) studying research findings pertinent to the project; (2) developing the project based on the findings; (3) field testing of the project, and (4) revising the project.
 The project was developed in sixty (60) working days, where prototypes were subjected to a dry run and simulation period of two (2) weeks continuous operation. The actual operation cycles of the prototypes in accordance with the varying room temperatures throughout the day was also observed during this period, testing them on a varied number of parameters, namely: operation time, turn on times in terms of fan speed control mode and motion sensitivity tests.
 Evaluation results revealed that the project functioned according to its lofty expectations where it was determined that it was the appropriate design that integrated the most practical and adaptable configuration for the intended application.

"Adaptation To Climate Change Among Farmers In Pandi, Bulacan: Implications For Improvement Of Adaptive Capacity","Pe√±alba, Ericson H.","The vulnerability of the Philippines to climate change and variability has been highlighted by its exposure
 to severe weather-related conditions. Farmers are particularly vulnerable to such adverse effects given
 their limited adaptive capacity. In this regard, this study examines the local adaptation experiences and
 practices of farmers in a second-class farming municipality. It is then based on the assumption that a lay
 understanding of how farmers perceive and adapt to climate change can be used to provide implications
 for enhancing their adaptive capacity. Using a combination of qualitative data from key informant
 interviews and focus group discussion and secondary data from government agencies, this paper reveals
 that farmers perceive serious health and livelihood risks despite having limited knowledge of how climate
 change occurs. They recognize that changes in climate conditions have caused considerable effects to
 temperature and rainfall which, in turn, have posed serious challenge to water supply. Their farming
 activities are also at risk from interrelated impacts such as damage to crops, pest infestation, and decrease
 in rice yield. Hence, they consistently employ common adaptation measures as direct responses to climate
 variability such as the planting of new crop varieties, use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, use of
 technology in farming, and diversification of household income. However, the lack of financial resources
 hinders them from utilizing new adaptation techniques and technologies, which they perceive to be more
 appropriate and beneficial. These results suggest a more conscious effort of transforming coping
 strategies to short-term climate variability into adaptation measures to long-term climate changes.",BulSU,Main
Exploring The Health Outcomes Of Conditional Cash Transfer Program In Rural Philippines,"Pe√±alba, Ericson H.","The Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program (4Ps), the first conditional cash transfer (CCT) program of the Philippine government, has become a popular approach aimed at improving the health and educational status of disadvantaged households. Its implementation is expected to advance the government‚Äôs health agenda, particularly in terms of child mortality reduction and maternal health improvement. Despite the growing evidence on the positive health outcomes resulting from the implementation of CCT programs, evidence remains limited to the qualitative evaluation of health care service utilization among beneficiary households. In this regard, by employing key interviews and focus group discussion, this study aims to examine the impacts of 4Ps on health and nutrition as experienced and perceived by beneficiaries at a community-level implementation. After subjecting the interview transcripts to thematic network analysis, the results reveal six dominant themes: enhanced health practices, improved uptake of health care services, increased awareness on health issues, improved living conditions, responsive program implementation, and persisting implementation challenges. While it is evident that the positive impacts are reflective of the beneficiaries‚Äô strict compliance to meet the program conditionalities, there is still much to be done to ensure the sustainability of the program. The provision for adequate health care should then be supplemented with reinforced delivery of the program‚Äôs learning component (family development session) and support mechanism to the implementers.",BulSU,Main

The main purpose of this paper is to determine the perceptions and experiences of climate change among coastal community residents in the Philippines. This study used a combination of methods, such as participatory mapping exercises, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and document analyses. The data, which were primarily collected from three coastal villages in the province of Bulacan, were subjected to a thematic network analysis. The findings revealed four dominant themes pertaining to climate change adaptation in a coastal community setting: vulnerability conditions, risk awareness, risk perceptions, and climate change awareness and perceptions. In particular, it was found out that the communities were exposed to the threats of natural hazards like flood and storm surge. Such exposure highlighted the residents' concerns over the risks of hazards on their livelihoods and properties. The residents also observed the unpredictability and the worsening effects of climate change. With their direct experiences of the natural hazards' impacts and awareness of the presence of risks, residents had undertaken actions to build their adaptive capacity.

This drink provides nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids beneficial, especially for those exposed to heavy work. ingredients. Mainly to analyze the safety of the prepared sports drinks based on the microbiological test 
 This study formulated a safe and healthy sports drink from locally grown vegetables and natural and toxicity/heavy metal contamination and the physicochemical properties based on pH and titratable acidity; to evaluate the nutritional value and composition of the formulated drinks thru approximate nutrient calculator on total sugar, vitamins, and minerals; and to initially evaluate the shelf life of Kalimbahin.
 This research was divided into three phases. Phase I includes an initial analysis of the microbial load, heavy metal contamination, and physicochemical properties. Phase II involves the evaluation of the nutrient contents of the formulated Kalimbahin sports drink. And Phase III finally analyzes the shelf-life and stability based on microbial load and nutritional components difference.
 Initial evaluation of its safety showed a consistent microbiological result of <10 CFU/mL for coliforms, molds and yeasts, where it can be inferred that all results fall within the acceptable level recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the Philippines. This can be supported by the phhysico-chemical properties of the formulated drink, which gives a low pH and high titratable acidity. The moderate acidity of the sports drink may have naturally prevented microbial proliferation in the sample. These results imply that the homemade processing and handling of the initially formulated sports drink complies with Good Manufacturing Practice. More so, the components and composition of the beverage were well-formulated, which did not support the growth of any of the microorganisms that may affect the sensory properties of the freshly prepared sports drink, or compromise the health and safety of the consumers. Analysis of its components highlights the presence of the electrolytes sodium and potassium which are essential components for a sports drink. The drink also contains vitamin C and calcium as additional benefits, and sufficient sugar which is important for the absorption of the electrolytes. The formulated sports drink initially shows its potential to provide energy to individuals with active lifestyles, and may also be utilized for managing diseases that are commonly associated with risks of dehydration such as dengue fever and Covid-19. The formulated Kalimbahin sports drink prepared from fruits and vegetables, is a healthy and natural alternative rehydration drink not only for athletes but for the recuperating patients as well, which may be taken without risk of intoxication due to the artificial flavors, chemicals, and other additives.

Reverse Migration During Pandemic: Narratives On The Quest Of Survival Of Returned Migrant Workers In The Philippines,"Astilla, Rebecca L.;Marcos, Claudine","According to the International Migration Report of 2019 conducted by the United Nations, about 272 million people estimated to be international migrants worldwide in 2019. Among the countries of Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, the largest sending countries of the region during 2000-2020 were China, Philippines, Myanmar, and Indonesia, while the largest receiving countries were Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia. Existing researches on return migration and reintegration have shown how countries in Southeast Asia including Philippines are dealing with the return of migrant workers using governments' efforts to reintegrate returnees into their community. However, while programs for returning migrant workers are evident on different studies, the issue of its efficacy during the ongoing health crisis remains a mystery. This paper utilized a narrative research design under qualitative research methodology to explain the life and experiences of returned migrant workers explores narratives from the return migrant workers during this current and ongoing global pandemic focusing on the Philippines as the largest labor sending country in Southeast Asia (Hugo, 2012). Specifically, it will try to answer the questions such as the challenges encountered by OFWs during repatriation and upon their arrival in the country and the government support towards returned migrants. The attempt to link reintegration with COVID-19 Pandemic is an essential endeavor to address what will happen next after migrant workers return to their country, especially during this present scenario where we witness the influx of returning migrants. Hopefully, this exploratory study will contribute to bringing forth systemic guidelines that will ensure that all returnees will have an opportunity to become an integral part of their communities.",BulSU,Sarmiento

Assessment Of Bulacan State University Employees Physical Activity,"Antonio, Anthony J.;Celso, Rafael;Mendizabal, Bengie;Tayao, Antonino","This research assessed Bulacan State University employee participants overall level of physical activity amidst the Covid-19 pandemic using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ version 2). The participants were randomly selected 173 employees from the different colleges, satellite campuses and offices of the university. The study utilized a sequential explanatory mixed-method design where the employee participants profile and overall level of physical activity were quantitatively described though a pre-validated questionnaire and the challenges and best practices of the employees in engaging to moderate- to vigorous- intensity physical activity were described qualitatively through semi-structured questions. Data analysis of the GPAQ survey results revealed that most of the employees‚Äô overall level of physical activity during the Covid-19 pandemic is LOW and manifested that most of the participants MET ‚Äì minutes/week were <600 which is categorized as INACTIVE. Engagement in physical activity of most of the employees logged as a daily but not everyone meets the WHO recommendation of allotting at least 150 minutes of moderate- intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous- intensity physical activity in a week. Setting-specific physical activity of the study participants showed that in all three domains, work-related, transportation-related, and recreational physical activity, most of the employees reported that they were not able to participate in moderate- to vigorous- intensity. Sedentary time of most of the employee participants in a day recorded 91 to 120 minutes in a day. The mean score of the participant in the following factors: Met ‚Äì minutes/week, Minutes/week of moderate- intensity physical activity and Minutes/week of vigorous- intensity, showed significant difference from the WHO recommendations. Age and Sex of the employees were the factors that indicated significant relationship to the overall physical activity level. The open-ended survey revealed that the employees experienced difficulties in engaging with moderate- to vigorous- intensity physical activities during the pandemic due to the prohibitions set by the government. The employees still understand the need to keep themselves physically active and they revert to doing household chores as alternative physical activity. Several employees also use digital platform-based exercise instructional materials to do exercise as additional physical activity during the period of the quarantine and work from home set-up. Given the opportunity, through programs spearheaded by the university to uplift the physical activity level, employees are willing to participate to as long as their safety is not compromised.",BulSU,Main

Preparations Undertaken By Ibm Employees For Office Automation In The Philippines,"Batac, Warren B.","The study examined the preparation of IBM Human Resource Transformation and Operations (HRTO) employees for the implementation of office automation in the Philippines. The study employed mixed methods type of research combining both quantitative and qualitative types of research. This study focused on one selected segment through which the company operates: Global Business Services (GBS). The population of the study were bona fide active employees of IBM. The respondents were also explicitly working at IBM Eastwood Libis, Quezon City site under the Human Resource Transformation and Operations (HRTO) department of IBM Business Services, Inc. 
 In terms of the selection of the respondents being studied, purposive convenience sampling technique was utilized. The study was done in two (2) stages. The first stage is about the respondents‚Äô personal profile such as age, educational attainment, and years of service in the company and their Career Adaptability Scales. The data collection ran from December 18 ‚Äì 31, 2019. The study was conducted in 1800 Building of Eastwood Libis, Quezon City site where approximately 150 professional employees of HRTO are presently working. Only the respondents who were able to finish the questionnaire within the 2-week period were included in the conduct of the study. Data was collected from 102 respondents.
 The first section was conducted to aid the selection participants for the second stage of the study. From 102 respondents, the researcher reached out to 20 participants who were selected based on their willingness and availability to proceed with the second stage of the research which is the interview process. While it was intended to evenly distribute the representation of respondents per age range, educational attainment, and length of service, the scheduling conflicts to conduct interviews as well as the limited number of respondents for certain demographic groups proved the endeavor not feasible. Nevertheless, the researcher has managed to get representatives from each group from the original population of 102 respondents.
 The result of the study revealed that the institutionalization of office automation in the HRTO department of IBM has significantly impacted the career paths of the employees. The employees are very adaptable to office automation and they continue to mold their careers by constantly adapting to technological changes. All of the IBM HRTO employees are very aware, and they are preparing for their vocational future. Certainly, the employees have strong beliefs about their personal responsibility to prepare for their careers. 
 The study concentrated on employees from one type of industry. The researcher recommended a quantitative study on the effects of automation to the job security of employees within the same industry.

Perception Of College Students On Teacher Bullying: Basis For Policy Inclusion In Bulsu Student Handbook And Bulsu Faculty Manual,"Cabrera, Maricor B.;Lazaro-Ordonez, Maria Theresa.;Mamitez, Mitchell","Bullying incidents are most prevalent in school settings. Bullying is defined as a phenomenon ‚Äúwhen a person is exposed, repeatedly and over time, to negative actions from more powerful peers‚Äù (Olweus and Limber, 2010). It could be verbal and/or physical. A study by the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) published by the OECD (2018) reports that 65% of Filipino students surveyed have experienced bullying at school. The same study also stated that both aggressors and victims of bullying exhibit low class attendance and poor school performance. Among aggressors and victims, experience of bullying in adolescence are linked to mental health problems experienced in adulthood. Bullying results to long-term mental problems (Sirgudson et. Al, 2015). 
  
  The prevalence of bullying is countered by legislative measures in the country. RA 10627 or Anti-bullying act of 2013 covers primary, elementary and secondary schools. It defines bullying as ‚Äúany severe or repeated use by one or more students of a written, verbal or electronic expression, or a physical act or gesture, or any combination thereof, directed at another student that has the effect of actually causing or placing the latter in reasonable fear of physical or emotional harm or damage to his property; creating a hostile environment at school for the other student infringing on the rights of the other student at school; or materially and substantially disrupting the education process or the orderly operation of the school.‚Äù It requires all elementary and secondary schools to implement policies to prevent and address bullying incidents in their schools. This law also allows an anonymous reporting of bullying incidents by students. The law also penalizes cyber bullying. As more students engage on internet activities, the incidence of cyberbullying has also risen. 
  
  These laws constrict bullying to an act committed by a student to another student. However, there are also incidents, albeit scarcely reported, of teacher bullying. There is a dearth of studies on teacher bullying students. McEvoy (2014) defined teacher bullying as a ‚Äúpattern of conduct, rooted in a power differential, that threatens, harms, humiliates, induces fear in or causes students substantial emotional stress.‚Äù In 2015, lawmakers recognized the prevalence of teacher bullying to students because of events when certain teachers in prestigious public and private schools faced lawsuits against their bullying acts on students. Senate bill 2793 filed by Senator Sonny Angara in 2015 aimed to supplement RA 10627 by penalizing teachers who were proven to be guilty of bullying students thru physical, cyber or verbal assaults. The penalty ranges from a fine of Php 50, 000 to imprisonment. This study aims to contribute in the documentation of the teacher bullying phenomenon. The study may serve as a basis for creating and/or improving the institution‚Äôs policies on the prevention and elimination of teacher bullying.",BulSU,Sarmiento

Four Cymbopogon plant samples namely: C. winterianus, C. nardus, C. flexuosus, and C. citratus were collected from selected provinces in the Philippines. After sample pre-treatment the leaves were preserved in silica gel until analysis. For ATR-FTIR analysis, the leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen and sieved to obtain uniform particle size prior to analysis. The PCA and HCA results showed successful discrimination of four Cymbopogon species. DNA Barcoding Analysis using rbcl marker, however, did not yield conclusive result since this marker can only identifying at the genus level or higher but not species of the plant samples.

The Impacts Of The Covid-19 Pandemic On The Left-Behind Children (Lbc) In The Philippines,"Astilla, Rebecca L.;Abuan, Romina Eloisa M.;Torres, Christine Belle E.","COVID-19 has put the world into a standstill affecting the everyday lives of individuals. The Left-Behind Children (LBC) of Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) are not spared as conditions change in labor receiving countries and in the Philippines. The challenges faced by the migrant parent(s) abroad and the repercussions brought by the pandemic immediately impacts the lives of LBC in the country. Towards elaborating how, in broad brush strokes, this exploratory study will use, draw, and compare studies on LBC done before and during the pandemic. This study answers questions such as how did COVID-19 affect the migrant parents‚Äô ability to support their children financially?; and how did the pandemic affect the migrant parents‚Äô ability to be emotionally present for their children? This paper also asks whether or not and how the pandemic increased the insecure financial situation of the LBC, if already present. Finally, this paper inquires into the LBC‚Äôs coping mechanisms during the pandemic. This study found that LBC and family were able to mediate through the uncertainties and financial insecurities despite the delay or decrease in remittances. The LBC were observed to have initiative and a role in the budgeting of household expenses, and have adjusted accordingly to the realities they face. Psychologically, they are steadfast even if worried about the condition of their OFW parent. This paper found that their coping mechanisms alongside sustained communication with their OFW parent to be significant to their well-being. Despite worrying about their OFW parents, LBC acknowledged that it is much safer for their parents to be abroad than at home.",BulSU,Sarmiento

"Innovative Solutions for the Emergency Response of CSU to Support the Frontliners and other Affected Sectors During the National Health Emergency due to COVID-19 Pandemic
 
 Project 1: Production and Distribution of the Ordinary Cloth Masks and 3D Printed Face Masks with Nano-reinforced Insert Filter 
 Project 2: Laser-Assisted Fabrication for the Mass Production of Face Shields
 Project 3: Chemistry in Action: Science-based Approach and Capability Building in Support to CSUs Response to Fight COVID-19 Pandemic in Caraga Region","Capangpangan, Rey Y.","The World Health Organization (WHO) has just declared the recent COVID-19 outbreak as pandemic. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19)
 prompted the scientific community to work hand-in-hand to combat the said viral pandemic. In the current statistics, the novel coronavirus not only causing
 harm to the common populace, and to the economy, but it is also affecting much of the health of the professionals, military personnel, and in all of the
 frontliners, in general. The scarcity of the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is now a prevalent problem, not only in the Philippines but also in other
 countries as well. The said PPE is highly needed by our frontliners, as the said materials will protect them for possible viral infection. However, due to the
 scarcity of these materials, most of our frontliners either did not wear any PPE, or just opt to use unfit home-made PPEs.
 As a state-funded institution, Caraga State University (CSU) is committed to support activities called by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) to
 address the need to fight against COVID-19. CSU is currently implementing mechanisms to efficiently carry out the various activities to help the most affected
 sectors, the frontliners. Through extension activity of the university, the products that were derived from extensive research activities will be distributed to
 the target beneficiaries who are affected by the current health crisis due to COVID 19 pandemic. Some of the activities being implemented by CSU is on the
 production of face shields, aerosol box, disinfectant cabinet, among others. Not only that, CSU is also facilitating the distribution of food packs to stranded
 students and people whose livelihoods are affected by the community quarantine, and even in the preparation of disinfectants. However, due to some
 ‚úì
 
 limitations in terms of financial resources, the university is also restricted in terms of the number of beneficiaries that can be supported. In order to address
 such limitations, CSU needs to enhance its existing capability to address the requirements for PPEs and other support to the various sectors most affected
 by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Thus this extension proposal is submitted to augment the needs of the university to do more in response to COVID-19.
 One of the potential areas that CSU can be of help in addressing the current health crisis is via the utilization of the emerging field of nanotechnology. Just
 early this year, the institution has approved the establishment of the Center for Nanoscience and Technology for Research and Entrepreneurship (CeNTRE),
 one of the RDI centers that focuses on the preparation of different nanomaterials for various applications. In the present situation, the importance of
 nanotechnology cannot be undermined to produce functional materials that can be used for our medical professionals. Similarly, CSU is equipped with
 qualified human resources (Chemists and Microbiologists) capable of formulating and generating products that can be used by the public such as disinfectants
 and hand sanitizers, among others in this time of health crisis. It is for this reason; this proposal was conceptualized. In this proposal, enhancement of the
 response mechanisms of CSU through nanotechnology and with the aid of capable human resources is being highlighted. In particular, attention on the care
 and support to our frontliners and to other most affected sectors is emphasized since these frontliners, and other affected sectors are the most vulnerable
 to viral infection. The said proposal has three major components as described below.
 
 Project components:
 Project 1: Mass Production and Distribution of the Ordinary Cloth Masks and 3D Printed Face Masks with Nano-reinforced Insert Filter
 The rapid outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had caused shortages on food and basic necessities, including personal protection equipment (PPE) such as
 face masks. To date, people are forced to use home-made and customized face masks made up of ordinary cloth due to the unavailability of standard
 disposable face masks in the market. Though this is an excellent initiative to mitigate the further spread of the virus, however, the capability of ordinary cloth
 is not enough to filter the air and droplets due to its porous structure. Hence, the enhancement of the filtering capacity of these masks is essential in ensuring
 the protection and safety of the users.
 Component 1: Production and Characterization of cellulose Nanocrystals as an insert Filter for the Ordinary Cloth Masks and the 3D-Printed Face Masks
 Cellulose is the most abundant natural polymer which can be extracted from vast sources of agricultural biomass such as wood pulp, grass stems, and leaves.
 Upon chemical treatment, cellulose could be transformed into its nanostructure, termed as nanocellulose (NC), which exhibits superior properties. Previous
 studies revealed that most NC possess intertwining fiber-like morphology that may trap dust and other particulate matter, which makes it a good candidate
 material for liquid and gas filtration application (Misra et al, 2018; Pui Yee Shak et al., 2018; Panchal et al., 2018). Also, NC is a promising material for various
 biomedical applications due to its biocompatibility.
 In light of this, the Center for Nanoscience and Technology for Research and Entrepreneurship (CeNTRE) has developed and optimized methodology in
 extracting nanocellulose films from existing raw materials (banana leaf, water hyacinth, rice husk, etc.) and make it as solid filter support for the 3D printed
 masks. Likewise, the extracted nanocellulose films will be utilized as insertion on the existing face masks made from ordinary cloth. While existing face masks
 are washable, these nanocellulose films are reusable since it will just serve as a secondary filter (next to the fabric) and will not directly touch the user‚Äôs face.
 
 Component 2: Production of 3D Printed Face Masks Utilizing the Fabricated Nanocellulose Film as Filter
 3D printing is one of the most viable technology which plays a significant role in terms of material production in the market today. As reported, it is a process
 which builds a three-dimensional object using a computer-aided software. It is also known that 3D printing process is now routinely used in a large-scale
 operation in the industry, as it provides excellent precision and repeatability. Materials, such as PPEs and other useful products were manufactured using 3D
 printing technology. It is noteworthy, that 3D printing technology provides a significant role in this time of national health crisis. The Fablab in Caraga State
 University produces PPE materials that will be used by our frontliners, such as face shields, face masks, aerosol box, among others.
 In this project, 3D printing technology will be utilized to produce 3D printed face masks. It is expected that the produced 3D face masks will be more durable
 and economical, in terms of the long-term use of the produced product. The process in producing this durable face masks includes the production of the 3D
 face masks and the filter that will be used will the product produced in the first component, that is the extracted cellulose nanocrystal films.
 Target Beneficiaries:
 The product that can be produced by this project can reduce the shortage of face masks. In Caraga, medical professionals and other frontliners are now
 seeking help from various agencies/institutions for supply of PPE. Also, security frontliners (police and Tanods) and other affected stakeholders are in need
 of PPE, particularly face masks.
 
 Target Beneficiaries Estimated Number
 1. Medical professionals (Doctors, Nurses, Volunteers) 1000
 2. Police personnel 1000
 3. Non-medical volunteers (e.g. Food, DSWD personnel, etc) 500
 4. LGUs 6
 5. Public and private frontliners 100
 6. Other stakeholders (Department stores, MSME, and other) 100
 
 Project 2: Laser-Assisted Fabrication for the Mass Production of Face Shields
 In the current crisis, the number of infected medical professionals treating COVID-positive patients are continuously rising. The usual predicament of medical
 frontliners, particularly those working in a government treatment facility is the lack of PPE. It cannot be discounted the importance of PPE, such as face shield
 to protect our medical professional to be infected during the treatment process. Face shield, as known by many, is a one type of PPE that will protect the
 wearer‚Äôs entire face from hazards such as the virus. However, due to the shortage of this PPE, medical frontliners were not able to secure for themselves,
 and thus they opted to use an improvise PPE. It is for this reason that there should be an immediate action to be taken to address such shortages of PPE.
 Caraga State University, trough the Fablab facility will be going to produce this type of PPE. It is also worth to mention that in order to be effective, detailed
 
 consideration in terms of its precision and the appropriate shape and other modalities of this face shield needs to be accounted for. Likewise, ergonomic
 consideration for the produced face shield will be addressed by the laser-assisted printing process. Fablab Caraga will establish a production line for the mass
 production line to provide mass-produced an effective face shields to be distributed to different beneficiaries. This project component also addresses
 shortage of PPEs such as face shield, especially for the need of medical frontliners and for the safety of CARAGA frontliners and patient in augmenting the
 initiative of our local government for an effective COVID-19 prevention and control.
 
 Target Beneficiaries Estimated Number
 1. Medical Frontliners 4,000
 2. Security/Safety Frontliners 3,000
 3. LGUs 3,000
 4. Government offices 500
 6. Other stakeholders 500
 
 Project 3: Chemistry in Action: Science-based Approach and Capability Building in Support to CSUs Response to Fight COVID-19 Pandemic in Caraga
 Region
 Component 1: Production and Distribution of Food and Non-Food Contact Surface Disinfectants, and Spraying Agents for Sanitization Tents for COVID-19
 Amidst this current health crisis due to COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgency for other professionals to help in producing materials that is critically useful
 in the society. For instance, Chemists, Microbiologists, Pharmacists, among others are now urged to help in the manufacturing or formulating disinfectants
 and other useful hand sanitizers to be used by our frontliners, especially to our health professionals, men in uniform, volunteers and to other affected sectors.
 In an effort to combat against the spread of the virus, it is highly recommended to cautiously practice good hygiene by constantly washing the hands with
 soap and/or by the application of hand sanitizers. Due to the shortages of the said materials, formulation and production of locally made disinfectants and
 sanitizers are deemed necessary. In this time, the help of other professionals such as Chemists/Pharmacists are expected.
 In response to the call for help, the Chemistry Department of Caraga State University proposed to create a team of experts to help LGUs, hospitals and other
 stakeholders to prepare disinfectants and sanitizers. In this project component, different disinfectant formulations will be made for both food and non-food
 contact surfaces. Also, disinfectants that will be used in sanitation cabins, that is safe to humans (as most of the chemical-based disinfectants are eye irritant
 and is not good for people having asthma problems) will be prepared. To make this effort sustainable, possible local sources of bioethanol will be explored
 for the production of bioethanol in the Caraga Region.
 
 Component 2: Bioethanol Production: Laboratory-Scale Proof-of-Concept Processing of Indigenous Raw Materials (Nipa, Palm, Molasses) for the Sustainable
 
 Production of Ethanol in Caraga
 
 In terms of sustainability, renewable sources of bioethanol from various indigenous materials have attracted considerable interest, as to the processing,
 extraction and to analysis. In this time of crisis, commercial supply of ethanol from the market is started to decline, hence alternative potential sources of
 ethanol needs to be explored. Caraga Region, dubbed as the ‚ÄúTimber Corridor‚Äù in the country, is blessed with majority of natural resources, including plants
 which contains high ethanol content. In particular, production of locally made wine from Nipa is one of the booming business in Butuan City. As known by
 many, Nipa is one of the most viable renewable sources of ethanol. Likewise, other sources such as Oil Palm, molasses, among others are commonly found
 in Caraga Region. Hence, in order to augment the supply of ethanol in the region, the Chemistry Department of CSU proposes to produce a laboratory-scale
 ethanol from various indigenous raw materials.
 
 Component 3: Capability Building and Support to Local Government Units in the Preparation and Handling of Chemical Agents for the Preparation of
 
 Disinfectants and Sanitizers
 
 Capability building to LGUs in the region is also an important aspect to be considered as far as the handling and preparation of any chemical agents are
 concerned. Undeniably, LGUs are under pressure especially in this trying time in fighting to contain the virus by applying disinfectants in all areas under their
 specific jurisdiction. However, due to the limited resources, they may opt to use disinfectants which are not suitable to a specific target application. Likewise,
 proper handling and preparation hampered their mobility to execute immediate response during disinfection. Thus, capability building in handling and
 preparation of chemical disinfectants is highly needed. Capability building is a process by which the LGUs will be capacitated by provding relevant and
 appropriate information, enhance the skills, and improvement of the resources, among others in order for them to execute their functions competently and
 able them to perform their duties at a greater capacity. The Chemistry Department will provide capacity building to the different LGUs in Caraga in terms of
 the proper handling and preparation of the needed disinfect and hand sanitizers.
 Target Beneficiaries:
 The different products that will be produced, such as 70% alcohol-based hand sanitizers and disinfectants (for Food and Non-food contact surfaces) will be
 distributed to the different LGUs, hospitals, checkpoints and other stakeholders in the Caraga Region.
 Target Beneficiaries Estimated Number
 Synthesis and Preparation of Nanocellulose membrane. The fabrication process will begin at the (1) collection of raw materials, (2) cleaning, drying, and
 milling, (3) chemical treatment which includes bleach, alkali, sulphuric acid treatment, and hydrolization, and finally (4) film-casting of the NC solution to
 form a film. Extraction process of the cellulose nanocrystals will be adopted from previously reported protocol with modifications. The treatment process
 will be modified based on the available reagents, e.g. bleaching agents and further optimization on the treatment process will be conducted. Likewise,
 appropriate proportion, such as the amount of the reagents per dry weight of the raw materials will be optimized. The obtained film will be used then as an
 insertion filter for existing cloth mask and as the filter for the 3D printed masks. Figure below (Figure 1) shows the schematic flow on the preparation of the
 cellulose nanocrystals and its subsequent integration to the 3D printed and ordinary cloth face masks, respectively.
 3D Printing. The available 3D printers (22) in the Fablab Caraga will be utilized in printing this target facemask design. Optimization on the amount of starting
 precursors/polymer solution and the printing speed will be done. It is being estimated that with the available equipment in Fablab, a total of 55 3D printed
 face masks can be produced in a day.
 QA and Safety Practices. Sample characterization will be conducted to evaluate the quality of the produced nanocellulose membrane. Surface morphology
 will be evaluated using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Surface functionality will also be assessed using FT-IR and porosity measurement will also be
 determined. Such characterization will be used to determine the quality of the produced nanocellulose membrane. Breathability and other physical test such
 
 as water retention test, filtration efficacy, antibacterial tests, among others will be conducted to ensure the good quality of the produced filter. The above-
 mentioned tests follow the standard and recommended protocols supervised by an expert, e.g. licensed chemist, and microbiologist.

 Mass production of the laser-assisted face shield will be done in this project component. The produced face shield uses acrylic sheets, PVC cover, and a
 garter. The clear cover will be the face cover to protect the wearer‚Äôs face. The acrylic sheet will be the head assembly that will hold the face cover. The garter
 will be used to secure the head assembly while it is worn by the wearer. The acrylic sheets will be cut using a laser cutter to create a good design and shape
 fits to the head assembly. Then, a garter will be measured according to the created design for fit. The mass production of this face shield will be done at
 Fablab Caraga.
 QA and Safety Practices: During production process, personnel in-charge for the production will wear an appropriate PPE to avoid exposure to solvents and
 other hazard that may pose during the production in accordance to the safety rules and preventive practices set by the Fablab. De-contamination will be
 done every now and then. Likewise, the produced face shield will be decontaminated (disinfectants prepared from other components of this project) prior
 for distribution.
 Project 3: Chemistry in Action: Science-based Approach and Capability Building in Support to CSUs Response to Fight COVID-19 Pandemic in Caraga Region
 Component 1: Production and Distribution of Food and Non-Food Contact Surface Disinfectants, Spraying Agents for Sanitization Tents for COVID-19
 Formulation of the Food and Non-Food Surface Disinfectants will be prepared based on the published protocol. The disinfectant for non-food contact surfaces
 will be prepared by mixing calcium hypochlorite (with 65% Cl strength) with water to attain 0.5 % OCl-
 
 (w/w%). Likewise, disinfectant for food contact surfaces
 
 will be prepared by mixing calcium hypochlorite with water to attain 0.02 % OCl-
 
 (w/w %) concentration. Spray agents on the other hand will be prepared.
 0.125% Povidone Iodine solution will also be prepared based on the established and the recommended formulation method by the World Health Organization
 (WHO).
 QA and Safety Practices. Preparation of the disinfectants for Food and Non-Food Contact Surfaces follows an accepted protocol. Wearing of an appropriate
 PPE was done during the preparation under a well-ventilated area. The quality and effectivity of the prepared disinfectants will be assessed by conducting
 bacterial inhibition tests (under the supervision of an expert/Microbiologists). Assessment on the degradation by-products of the said disinfectants will be
 evaluated by UV degradation study. Protocols for the preparation of an alcohol-based hand sanitizers will be based on WHO recommended methods.
 Personnel/Analysts performing such formulation will be supervised by a licensed Chemist and GLP during experimentation stage will be strictly followed.
 Component 2: Bioethanol Production: Laboratory-Scale Proof-of-Concept Processing of Indigenous Raw Materials (Nipa, Palm, Molasses) for the Sustainable
 
 Production of Ethanol in Caraga
 
 Raw materials to be used for the extraction of ethanol will be obtained from a local Laksoy (Nipa Wine) manufacturer in Butuan City and other nearby
 provinces. Two potential raw materials for bioethanol production can be utilized for ethanol production, e.g. Nipa sap and Nipa . There are several small
 enterprises in Butuan City and other provinces who are manufacturing a Nipa wine, called Laksoy. The said locally made wine can be directly used as a raw
 material for the production of ethanol by subjecting the said raw material in a fractional distillation method, to extract ethanol from Laksoy. After a thorough
 optimization on the appropriate distillation condition, it is being expected that a high purity ethanol can be produced from Laksoy. Similarly, Nipa sap can
 also be used as a raw material for bioethanol production. Nipa sap will be collected with the help of the local Nipa farmers in the area. Initial analysis will be
 conducted to the collected Nipa sap. Total sugar will be determined, and further sterilization will be made via heat treatment at 100 oC for a certain time
 (e.g. 10 min). Yeast fermentation of the sterilized Nipa sap will be done by the addition of inoculated yeast in an appropriate medium (part of the optimization
 
 process). The same fermentation conditions and optimizations will be applied to other samples, such as sugar cane sap/molasses, oil palm sap, among others.
 Fermentation will be done in duplicate in an incubator at 28 oC for a period of 0 ‚Äì 48 hours. Sucrose will be used as a control. Nutrient supplements will be
 added during fermentation as needed. After the fermentation, the produced ethanol will be subjected to fractional distillation to obtain high purity ethanol.
 QA and Safety practices. The quality and the purity of the produced ethanol will be evaluated by conducting comprehensive analysis. The purity of the
 ethanol will be evaluated using Gas Chromatography/HPLC analysis. Supplemental physical tests will be done to ensure that the ethanol is indeed obtained,
 not the other form of alcohol. Fourier Transform Spectroscopy analysis will also be conducted to differentiate ethanol from other potential by products
 formed during the fermentation process. Likewise, density analysis, and flame test will also be conducted to ensure the quality of the produced ethanol.
 Component 3: Capability Building and Support to Local Government Units in the Preparation and Handling of Chemical Agents for the Preparation of
 
 Disinfectants and Sanitizers
 
 Preliminary discussions among the members of the team will be done. Outlining on the potential areas to be discussed during the capability training will be
 discussed with the team members. Identification of the strength and weaknesses of each of the LGU will then be done, putting emphasis on the area of their
 actions and response to COVID-19 pandemic. An official communication will then be sent to the different LGUs in the region stating the intention t conduct
 capability building on selected personnel who are in charge of the disaster and immediate response team on their respective jurisdiction. Such letter is duly
 endorsed by the CSU President. Once the LGCU will give authorization for the team to conduct the capability building, deployment of the team members

Needs Assessment of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in BARMM towards Enhancing Their Research Competencies through an Institutional-Level Sustainable Professional Development Model,"Varela, Rowena P.","The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) is a new region in southern Philippines. The ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law following a plebiscite on January 21, 2019 paves the way for the formal creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The creation of the BARMM, however, requires building the human capital to suppor the region's socioeconomic development. Thus, the BARMM needs to enhance the capability of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to produce graduates in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). To optimize the utilization of natural resources of the region, strengthening the capability of HEIs in research and innovation is likewise very important. Hence, assistance to develop and enhance the capability of HEIs in BARMM through an institutional -level sustainable professional development will be done.
 The Caraga State University (CSU) is among the five (5) State Universities in Mindanao classified as SUC Level 4 in the latest SUC Leveling. It has an interesting experience in leapfrogging from SUC Level 2 to Level 4 due to its improved competencies in research that fueled its increased research productivity aside from its performance in teaching. This experience can be shared to HEIs in the BARMM. Its professional development model can be shared to the leaders and faculty members of HEIs in the region. The program on enhancing research competencies of HEIS in BARMM through an institutional-level sustainable professional development is seen to redefine the quality of HEIs in the BARMM. Building and/or enhancement of research competencies of the faculty member in an HEI is very important in institutional building. It is always said that any organization is as good as its people.

 Monitoring and evaluation on the awareness on HECTOR
 Establish linkage on TNE with foreign universities
 From the legal standpoint, this project is a response to RA 10650, an Act Expanding Access in Educational Services
 by Institutionalizing Open Distance Learning in Levels of Tertiary Education, Policy Framework and Strategies on the
 Internationalization of Philippine Higher Education (CMO No. 55, s. 2016) and Policies, Standards and Guidelines on
 Transnational Education (CM0 No.62, s. 2016). Overall, the HECTOR project will run for a period of 2 years, effective
 upon approval. In support of the CHED initiatives on TNE, this project hopes to transcend the country's intensive drive
 to globalization amidst the internal and external pressures that influence quality education. This research is aligned
 with the RDE agenda of CHED on the conduct of relevant and responsive RDE aimed at generating, adapting and
 transferring new knowledge and most innovative technology for improving productivity, promoting peace and equality
 among countries, and ensuring quality education and lifelong learning for all. As a major breakthrough in TNE initiatives,
 the HECTOR Project ensures a coherent strategy in building strong cooperation among HEls and promises a positive
 impact to the country's membership to ASEAN Cyber Universities (ACU). Equally important, HECTOR serves as a
 platform for a comprehensive database on TNE in the Philippines in response to the demand for a coherent national
 strategy to encourage and facilitate the establishment of the most effective types of transnational higher education
 (TNHE) programs and institution in the country as stipulated in the proposed House Bill on the formulation of a legal
 framework for TNHE in the Philippines.
 B. Literature Survey
 In this time of increasing impact of globalization on education, most higher education institutions have become a
 potential channel in exploring a wide range of opportunities that will boost and attract international partnership and
 linkage. However, the process and practices that take place into the actual implementation vary across the world and
 even within a country given the varying economic, cultural and political conditions and educational systems which have
 underlying effects on the development of HEls in becoming a global market hub. In the Philippines, the issue of quality
 education and global policies and regulations has remained to be a serious concern, yet most HEls have continuously
 engaged in numerous academic and cultural partnerships with foreign neighbors.
 In a recent multi-pronged study on the opportunities and challenges of transnational education (TNE) programs in the
 Philippines conducted by the British Council in 2016, the findings affirmed that ""all the elements are in place for a
 receptive TNE environment in the Philippines given a growing population (especially amongst the youth) and economy,
 a high level of proficiency in English and a good regulatory framework is in place headed by CHED."" While the study
 argues that there is a growing demand for TNE in the country, one serious challenge rests on the dearth of information
 on TNE programs, nature and operation and management. By far, this study on TNE conducted by the British Council
 in 2016 has addressed only the opportunities and challenges of TNE in the Philippines from the perspectives of officials,
 faculty and students of selected HEls in the country. As a major offshoot of this initiative, only 10 universities in the
 Philippines were selected to take part in TNE partnerships with UK counterparts through the Commission on Higher
 Education (CHED). Given the challenges, limitations and lack of pervasive knowledge on TNE in the country, the
 pressures of globalization and internationalization and its profound effects on educational system and policy will
 definitely become more difficult to address.
 Based on literature, there is quite a few number of studies on TNE in the Philippines. Notably influential in the proposed
 project is the study conducted by the British Council in 2016 on the opportunities and challenges of transnational
 education (TNE) programs in the Philippines. In order to examine a grasp of the operation, implementation and
 experience of tertiary education on TNE, this review presents some of the relevant studies on TNE in international
 context.
 It is worth noting how TNE creates a promising opportunity in the Philippines. In a review of the context of TNE in the
 Philippines conducted by the British Council (2016), an interesting account points to a fact that ""the Philippines presents
 a unique environment for TNE providers, as well as unique opportunities and challenges. Its economy and youth
 population are growing, and the Commission for Higher Education (CHED) provides a supportive regulatory
 environment for internationalization. The welcoming TNE regulatory environment, combined with the institutionalized
 medium of English, the temperate climate, the country's growing population and economy, as well as communications
 and digital infrastructure, make the Philippines an attractive prospect for TNE providers.""
 While TNE sets a favorable future in the Philippines, there seems to be few research attempts on the extent of TNE
 operations in the Philippines and limited formal database management system that will provide accurate and accessible
 TNE information, thus making it difficult to boost internationalization. As reported by the British Council (2016), the
 internationalization of the tertiary sector in Asia has fostered competition, with a number of nations - notably Singapore
 and Malaysia - claiming education hub status. The Philippines has undertaken several regional initiatives to boost
 student mobility. As a member of ASEAN, the Philippines is party to the ASEAN Credit Transfer System, the ASEAN
 International Mobility for Students (AIMS) programme and the ASEAN University Network (AUN). Moreover, the ASEAN
 AIMS programme fosters student mobility and credit transfer between specific institutions in member countries and
 includes the five top Philippine universities: University of the Philippines, De La Salle, the University of Santo Tomas,
 Saint Louis University and Ateneo de Manila. The Philippines is also party to the University Mobility in Asia and the
 Pacific (UMAP) agreement which promotes exchange, joint programs and research consortia between participating
 higher education institutions with a corresponding UMAP Credit Transfer Scheme (UCTS).

 Compared to other Asian countries, TNE operations in the Philippines are also limited in number, particularly with Asian
 markets like Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and China. As part of its internationalization initiatives, CHED has
 recently signed education agreements with Canada, Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Palau, Poland, and Spain.
 (British Council, 2016).
 The study of Su, Kim and Lee (2018) on thee-Learning Preparedness for Higher Education of ASEAN Countries shared
 an assessment of the preparedness of Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. The key findings showed that 1) infrastructure
 fore-Learning has improved significantly as there are more options fore-Learning initiatives and universities, more and
 more universities adopt ICT and gaps still exist between have and have-nots; 2) policy (legal framework) has not caught
 up yet - -in progress in most countries, but in varying degree; No cyber or fully online university (except existing open
 and distance institutions), online degrees are now growing in numbers (not sure about quality) but most of them take
 ""blended learning"" approach to comply with the existing laws and regulations; 3) Not so friendly environment for
 innovators as evidenced by: either too much or too little government intervention. Centralized control and regulation,
 fragmented and lack of coordination, and no legal framework that would enable e-learning to reach out and grow; 4)
 Awareness has improved significantly re: e-learning and importance of ICT use for educational purposes, to wit:
 university leadership and professors now do understand, policy makers also recognize its potentials, and more and
 more techy and younger instructors in university; 5) Tools are available as there are LMS that can be built with little
 investment if open-source tools are used and more alternatives are becoming available and affordable; and 6) Human
 Resource would require skilled technicians who are available or have been trained, more capacity building is needed
 in design, managing, teaching online, and evaluation (e.g., assessment of learning outcomes, action research) and the
 issue of whether to train vs. recruit? Jack of all trade in e-Learning?; 7) Public schools are offering ICT literacy education
 and even e-learning experiences as early as primary school thus, teachers are becoming more and more equipped
 and students are also more tech-friendly; 8) No significant presence of foreign (e-learning) institutions due to policy
 and language barriers and not many online programs settled in ASEAN countries; and 9) Quality improvement has
 been a major focus and significant effort have been exerted since AUN QA guideline and criteria are recognized and
 honored in most ASEAN institutions.
 The potential of TNE in the Philippines has put forward a positive implication to intensify the cooperation to ACU
 spearheaded by the ACU Korean Research Team. This model consists of three stages: the initial, intermediate and
 matured. The last stage will present the completed substance of ACU after the previous stages. Each stage requires
 defining the roles and responsibilities of the stakeholders and rules and regulations.
 Initial Stage: Sharing the education program by e-Learning
 ACU encourages the participating institutes and cyber universities from ASEAN and Korea to carry out cooperative
 education curricula and programs. It will be a foundation to elaborate existing education resources uploaded at the
 ACU platform and carry out new materials and sources attracting learners in the ASEAN region. By utilizing LMS and
 relevant e-Learning resources, the participating institutes and cyber universities jointly design and operate the programs
 Intermediate Stage: Providing credits and Organizing credit bank system
 Prior to the matured stage, ACU starts to issue credits based on the joint agreement between participating institutes
 and cyber universities and the credits are officially recognized and accredited. With the participation of the companies,
 these credits are applicable for the learners to get decent jobs and maintain their studying in higher education institutes.
 For the later stage, the intermediate stage is also to operate credit bank system, which helps the learners to get credits
 and accumulate them to complete the whole course of undergraduate school.
 Matured Stage: Awarding the 4-Year undergraduate degree
 This is the stage to complete the substance of ACU as a four-year university. The learners admitted to the courses
 and/or others getting required credits from the credit bank system can get the degree recognized by the ASEAN
 member states.
 These three stages need to be started with proactive participation of member states and well-organized resources
 Prior to implementing three stages, 'preparatory stage' is expected. At this stage, a governing body needs to be settled
 for collecting required resources and coordinating communication and dialogue between participating institutes. With
 this body, ASEAN member states and Korean government need to consider how to harmonize roles and responsibilities
 and reduce barriers of different rules and regulations of higher education system for launching agreed model of ACU.
 Also, for attaining the proposed model and strategy, it is critical to define the roles and responsibilities of the
 stakeholders, rules and regulations including the accreditation of credits and degree of cyber university and participation
 of private sectors. (Source: Briefing Note on the Proposal for the Establishment of ASEAN Cyber University (ACU),
 August 31,2018)
 In terms of global standards, McBumie and Ziguras (2001) point out that the millennium round of the General Agreement
 on Trade in Services (OATS) underlines issues relating to the regulation of education as an internationally traded
 service. Transnational education is a key component of such trade. Southeast Asia is something of a laboratory in the
 development and regulation of transnational education. The region combines high demand, keen competition among
 providers, and host country regulatory regimes ranging from relatively laissez faire to strongly interventionist. This paper
 examines the approaches of three Southeast Asian governments ‚Äî Hong Kong, Malaysia and Australia ‚Äî to the
 regulation of transnational education within their borders. In each case the authors provide background on the higher

 education system, describe the regulatory approaches to transnational education, and analyze the motivations behind
 regulation. Both the neoliberal approach of the WTO to trade in educational services, and critiques of this approach,
 are outlined. The authors conclude that any attempts to promote global standards or quality principles for transnational
 education must address the myriad concerns of governments, including consumer protection, advancing national goals
 and protecting the local system.
 Hefferman, Morrison, Basu and Sweeney (2010) explored the transnational education from the Australian perspectives.
 Australian universities have been active participants in the transnational education market over the past twenty years.
 Many Australian universities have structured various forms of franchising arrangements with universities and other
 education providers, particularly with educational institutions in China. However, the cultural differences between
 Australia and China are substantial; furthermore, research has shown that Chinese students have unique
 characteristics that differentiate them from Western students. Nevertheless, Australian universities develop and
 implement programs in China with limited understanding of these differences. Consequently, to administer these
 programs better academics need to understand the differences that might exist in Chinese student cohorts. One area
 of possible difference is learning styles. Hence, the aim of this study was to explore the differences in learning styles
 between business students in China and Australia. The results suggest that there are substantial differences in learning
 styles between the two countries. Consequently, program managers need to consider these differences when
 structuring course offerings for students in China.
 Similarly, Feast and Bretag (2007) conducted a case study of an Australian university involved in the delivery of
 transnational programs in an educational environment that has been increasingly characterized by commercial
 consideration& The researchers conducted focus group interviews with both general and academic staff to ascertain
 the personal, academic and administrative issues affecting the delivery of educational programs in Asia that arose as
 a result of one particular crisis in 2003: the SARS epidemic. The findings indicate that both administrative and academic
 staff felt personally and professionally challenged by the complexity of the issues involved in interrupting the pattern of
 transnational teaching. Potentially conflicting rationales emerged through the focus group discussions, with
 administrative staff expressing concern with maintaining services while lecturers articulated a preoccupation with the
 safeguarding of assessment standards.
 In another study of McBumie and Poplock (2010) is the experience of Monash University which identifies a range of
 opportunities and risks involved in transnational education and addresses a number of key planning issues in
 establishing an international campus. These include the guiding principles adopted by the university, country selection
 factors, market research, considerations in developing an appropriate delivery model, and the assurance of the
 academic quality and educational integrity of the programmes offered. The authors refer to literature in the field
 conceming corporate risk and identify factors relevant to the higher education sector. The article stresses the need for
 an appropriate integration of strategic vision, academic priorities, and business considerations to ensure that
 opportunities offered by transnational education are successfully realized.
 For Naidoo (2008), trans-national higher education (TNHE) development is not an entirely new international activity in
 the education services sector. The nature and scale of the global expansion of contemporary TNHE developments are,
 however, changing substantially. An understanding of this growth is currently largely lacking because of a dearth of
 comprehensive statistics. The scale of the latter TNHE developments has been particularly hard to identify and has
 until now been largely based on guesstimates. This article is an attempt at filling this gap. Through a triangulation
 methodology of available secondary data, this article is a very first attempt at providing a stock take of the current level
 of activity in TNHE worldwide.
 In terms of Asian context, Fang (2011) presents an empirical study of transnational higher education in China at the
 institutional level. The units of analysis are the Chinese partner universities of transnational higher education programs.
 Through comparison of research universities and teaching universities, the study finds that transnational higher
 education programs are developed and perceived differently by these two categories of universities. For teaching
 universities, transnational higher education is mainly used to expand enrollment. It is the most active internationalization
 activity on campus. For research universities, especially top research universities, transnational higher education's
 major function is to provide academic opportunities for those aspiring for advanced professional degrees. It is only one
 of the many internationalization activities on campus. Teaching universities tend to use transnational higher education
 more to generate revenue and reduce cost
 On the same note, Lim (2010) emphasizes that assuring the quality of transnational education has been an endeavor
 of increasing importance in the internationalization of higher education but is also increasingly challenging given the
 involvement of many stakeholders. This paper focuses on the experiences of and challenges faced by private tertiary
 education providers in Malaysia and Singapore, which are major importers of Australian degrees, in coping with the
 varied and increasingly demanding requirements of different quality assurance goals, emphases and systems.
 Interviews with staff from private providers of tertiary education in both countries revealed that the existence of a large
 number of different requirements based on varied standards leads to counter-productive and ineffective outcomes such
 as the diversion of resources The experiences of Malaysia and Singapore provide valuable lessons for emerging
 economies, including China and India, both of which will likely be major educational providers in the coming decades.
 Equally interesting is the work of Leung and Waters (2013) which interrogates the presumptions that the fundamental
 logic of transnational education programs is a one-to-one transfer of institutional capital across space and an unimportance of place and argues that space and place play an important role in transnational education. Drawing on
 research that examines the experiences of students and graduates of British degree programmes offered in Hong
 
 Kong, they conclude that institutional capital does not always travel wholly and smoothly due to a combination of policy-
 related, social, cultural and economic factors. The findings also underline the importance of place in students'
 
 experiences, which are not sufficiently recognized by the providers. This, in turn, affects the ability of students to
 cultivate institutional and other forms of social capital, with implications for subsequent employment opportunities and social mobility",CavSU,Main
Mitigating Measures and Devices: Addressing COVID-19 Pandemic,"Corpuz, Onofre S.","This study will cover 2 major activities to be completed. It shall be guided by the Project framework below:
 
 As can be seen, fabrication of Protective Face Shield (PFS) is the main activity which this study will accomplish. This activity will be produced and distributed
 (output) to the beneficiaries (frontliners and students). Consequently, this project will lessen the rampant problem in which the government is facing at the
 moment, the scarcity of supply of PFS that is vital for the protection and prevention of the spread if the disease (COVID- 19), as well as treatment for the
 patients diagnosed as Positive, PUI and PUM or as Suspect, Probable or Confirmed cases (revised classification of individuals given by World Health Organization,
 March 20, 2020). With this venture, the University can help in alleviating the increasing rate of COVID-19 transmission across the Davao region.
 
 The project shall be based at the Digihub FabLab of the College of Technology in the University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP). A shared service facility
 with its agency partners, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and Department of Science and Technology (DOST).
 The fabrication of the PFS shall follow the safety protocol and guidelines of the Fabrication Laboratory. It shall abide with the safety protocol as stipulated
 in USeP ISO 9001:2015.
 Distribution Plan
 In the distribution of PFS the following steps shall be observed to ensure that all distribution activities shall be in accordance with COA rules. It shall also
 consider equity in the distribution of the equipment.
 1. USeP Action Center shall coordinate with all beneficiaries through email/text message on the details of their respective communities (i.e. number of
 frontliners, number of students, number of PFS needed).
 2. Project team shall prioritize recipients based on criteria (e.g. number of cases (PUMs and PUIs, availability of PPEs, etc.)
 3. Project team shall prepare schedule of deliveries or pick-up schedule.
 4. Project team shall prepare acknowledgment receipts (format shall be based on COA requirements)
 a. It can be bulk receipt by the official accepting officer of the province/municipality/barangay/hospital.
 b. It can be head of checkpoint.
 5. Other supporting documents shall include pictures of the turn-over or video.
 6. Acceptance receipt shall include full name of receiving officer, including contact details, dates and fresh signature.
 Sustainability Plan
 In order to sustain the project, the facilitation of these three (3) activities is vital: (1) Promotion, (2) Student Entrepreneurship, and (3) Research.
 Promotion. This activity supports or provides active encouragement to increase public awareness, which consequently will increase demands of
 the finished product. If the public is aware that the University through its Fabrication Laboratory is fabricating such products, then it will be easy for the
 University to use it as an Income Generating Project (IGP) during this crisis only. The donation itself is already one way of promoting the products not only
 to the mass but also to the hospitals and LGUs, including the frontliners. Sales will take place after the pandemic. The mere fact that the public is already
 aware that the University can manufacture such products, USeP can now put value (price) on each product produced. The sales will now be used for
 another round of fabrication.
 Student Entrepreneurship. This activity allows students to learn more than just their chosen field of study, and creates an interdisciplinary environment to
 work and develop in. The network and friendships which develop help students to become better connected once they leave the University and help
 them prepare for long term success. The University will tap the students aligned with business-related courses such as BS in Entrepreneurship and BS in
 Business Administration. These students will help in promoting and selling the fabricated products.
 Research. Through research, the University shall be able to make innovation on the existing product or may create other products essential for mitigation
 and adaptation during calamities. In addition, this facility shall not only serve as a fabrication hub during calamities, but shall also serve as a venue for
 prototyping of new technologies.",CFCST,Main

Life Enabling and Blended Continuing Education Program for Rehabilitated Drug Patients,"Porciuncula, Fe L.","The project is comprehensive which is based on the very
 principles of continuing education which are self-directed,
 enriching, experiential and utilizes blended learning modalities

 continuing education program that utilizes appropriate blended
 learning system and utilization of agriculture, fisheries and food
 technologies to equip rehabilitated drug patients, providing
 them necessary knowledge and skills that will enable them to
 start a productive life after rehabilitation and contribute in
 nation building when they are reintegrated in the mainstream
 society.
 The specific objectives are: (1) mobilize the rehabilitated drug
 patients and assess their learning needs; (2) determine the
 status of the rehabilitation center in terms of resources and
 
 operational standards; (3) develop subject-focused and local-
 specific assessment tools for screening potential students; (4)
 
 develop modular short term courses from available packages of
 appropriate technologies; (5) implement the program via
 Online/Classroom Learning System and hands on training on
 agri-fisheries and food technologies; (6) provide start-up kits for
 graduates willing to venture on agri-fisheries and food
 processing endeavors and (7) develop a protocol for continuing
 education that can be replicated to all rehabilitation centers in
 the country.
 The concept is innovative in the sense that this will address the
 common problems faced by the 70-80% of rehabilitated drug
 patients going into relapse due to several causes and lacking of
 productive activity after medical intervention and
 mainstreaming into the society. Anent to this is the provision of
 livelihood start up kits to interested and capable graduated
 patients to venture in a livelihood of their choice. The outcome
 to be measured after the 2nd year of project implementation are
 hoped to be seen in terms of increased employability of
 graduates allowing them to have additional source of income
 from both employment and the establishment of startup
 livelihood endeavors, and that many or some of the rehabilitated
 patients will undergo further studies and that a productive
 reintegration in the mainstream society is achieved with no
 recurrence of drug addiction.",CLSU,Main

 The LiDAR Technology
 LiDAR is an active remote sensing technology that measures distance between a sensor and reflecting objects
 such as Earth's surface, buildings and trees. LiDAR is a new spatial data acquisition system that presents
 complementary or even alternative solutions to the acquisition of spatial information unanswered by existing
 technologies such as aerial photography or satellite imagery. Modem computers and DGPS (Differential Global
 Positioning System) make this technology practical and it is typically used in very accurate mapping of topography.
 The coverage and accuracy of topographic data extracted by these systems, complemented by the features detected
 by an onboard digital aerial camera, provides rich information that would greatly benefit agencies using spatial data
 Data verification and validation project acts as a quality control for the output of the program. LiDAR is a rapid
 geospatial data acquisition system that can produce robust datasets and collect data in a wide range of conditions.
 The applications of LiDAR Technology are for hazards and disasters (Floodplain and drainage, mapping; landslide
 susceptibility, Climate change (e.g. sea level rise); resource inventory and assessment (Agriculture, Fisheries,
 Forestry, Mining, Energy and Environment; infrastructure planning and monitoring (Inventory of buildings and key
 infrastructures, Transportation routes, Development corridors); and governance (Land use and local development
 planning, zoning, Utilities and urban services, Revenue generation (tax mapping, real property, administration).",CLSU,Main

 The main objective of the study is to develop a full-packed nutd-chip that is both nutritious and delicious out of the
 abundantly available and cheap raw materials of the country, which are mushroom, seaweed and moringa. The
 Municipality of Anda, Pangasinan is chosen as the pilot community. It is prone to natural hazards such as, coastal
 flooding and storm surge. There is also prevalence of malnutrition in the coastal barangays of Municipality of Anda.
 Specific Objectives:
 Determine the quality and social acceptability of the product;
 Determine the nutritional content and shelf-life of the nutri-chip;
 Determine the economic feasibility of the nutri-chip;
 Develop the capability of the communities involved; and
 Disseminate information about the nutri-chip.
 The Nutri-chip
 Nutri-chip is a nutrition-packed food that is palatable, delicious and convenient to eat anywhere and anytime. It is a
 thin-sliced chip made of three nutritionally valuable and locally available ingredients. It will be attractive to all ages
 because of its crunchy properties and right saltiness.
 Nutri-chips are thin slices whose moisture content decreases from around 80 percent to almost 2 percent when they
 are fried. Frying in hot oil at temperatures between 160¬∞ and 180¬∞C is characterized by very high drying velocities,
 which are critical to improve not only the mechanical but also the structural properties of the chips (Baumann and
 Escher, 1995). Nutri-chips will be subjected to vacuum frying as an alternative technique to develop low oil content
 chips.
 Vacuum frying may be an option for production of fruits and vegetables with low oil content and the desired texture and
 flavor characteristics. It is defined as the frying process that is carried out under pressures well below atmospheric
 levels, preferably below 50 Torr (6.65 kPa). Due to the pressure lowering, the boiling points both of the oil and the
 moisture in the foods are lowered. Vacuum frying poses some advantages that include: (1) can reduce oil content in
 the fried product, (2) can preserve natural color and flavors of the product due to the low temperature and oxygen
 content during the process, and (3) has less adverse effects on oil quality",CLSU,Main

"Ethnomycological Expedition: Genetic conservation and germplasm preservation of macroscopic fungi in Luzon
 
 Project Components:
 1. Conduct of ethnomycological studies and collection of wild macroscopic fungi in Luzon
 2. Identification of collected fungi species using molecular technique and morphological characterization
 3. Cryopreservation and maintenance of wild and underutilized macroscopic fungi in Luzon","Undan, Jerwin R.","The Philippines is included in the 18 mega diverse countries in the world, harboring about 70% of
 all life forms including the macroscopic fungi or also known as the mushrooms. However, most of these
 macroscopic fungi have not been identified and properly documented in detail. These resources must be
 collected and must maintained and preserve accordingly for future research undertakings for the benefit of
 mankind. The presence of these mushroom are affected by seasonal fluctuations and some were close to
 extinction as affected by climate change. Genetic conservation and preservation of these mushrooms are
 important, for us to understand and document the Philippine fungal biodiversity and promote education
 and awareness about our existing mushrooms in the Philippines. The main objective of the project is to
 identify the wild and underutilized macroscopic fungi. Specifically to; (1) conduct ethnomycological studies
 and to collect the wild macroscopic fungi in the selected area in Luzon (2) to identify the collected species
 using molecular technique and at the same time perform morphological characterization and lastly, (3) to
 perform cryo-preservation technique for germplasm preservation and maintenance of wild and
 underutilized macroscopic fungi in Luzon.
 For the methodology on Study 1 (Ethnomycological studies and collection of wild and underutilized
 macroscopic fungi), provinces in Luzon with known indigenous communities will be selected in this study.
 A questionnaire will be prepared and used for the ethnomycological survey in the indigenous community in
 selected areas of Luzon. At least 15 respondents will be interviewed during the survey in each research
 sites. A group discussion will also be conducted during the expedition to document their traditional beliefs,
 knowledge, attitudes, practices, perception, and utilization towards the macroscopic fungi in their area. At
 the same time, collection of fruiting bodies of mushrooms will be done. The mushroom samples will be
 photographed in their habitat, will be cleaned and placed in a paper bag with proper labeling and will be
 brought in to the laboratory to rescue mycelia following the standard protocol in the tissue culture of
 mushroom. A database for the collected macrofungi will be done in this study. For Study 2 (Molecular and
 morphological characterization of wild and underutilized macroscopic fungi), The DNA from the fruiting
 bodies and mycelia will be isolated for molecular identification. The DNA will be extracted using CTAB
 method. The DNA will be quantified and diluted to obtain 1 rig/p1 before PCR amplification. The ITS
 fragment of the genome will be used and amplified for molecular identification using the ITS1 or IT53 (as
 forward primer) and ITS4 primer (for reverse). The amplified product will be sent to FirstBase Laboratory at
 Malaysia for sequencing. The chromatogram result will be used for BLAST (Basic Local Search Tool)
 analysis for sequence query and identification. On the other hand, the main characteristics of mycelia such
 as texture, density, color and growth will be observed. Lastly for Study 3 (Germplasm preservation and
 maintenance of the wild and underutilized macroscopic fungi), the Mushroom Genetic Conservation
 Laboratory (MGCL) will be established in the Biotech Building of the Central Luzon State University, this
 will served as the genebank or repository of the collected macroscopic fungi. The mycelia will be
 aseptically grown from the vegetative cultures (fruiting body) by performing consecutive mycelium
 inoculations on malt extract agar until an axenic culture will be attained. The mycelia will then be preserved
 in cryovial with 15% glycerol and will be stored at -80¬∞C cryo-freezer (maintaining the Mycelia' viability for
 long term storage). The DNA of the sample will also be stored at at -80¬∞C cryo-freezer. On the other hand,the fruiting body will be preserved using freeze-drying technique. The fruiting bodies will be cooled rapidly
 in a freeze drier to -30¬∞C for a period of 3 hours, and then will be subjected at a temperature of about 85
 ¬∞C with a pressure of 5mTorr (0.666 Pa).
 Conservation and preservation of biodiversity is very important nowadays. One of the most
 common strategies in this effort is by establishing and maintaining a genebank of genetic resources from
 wild populations. Setting up of gene bank and/or repository for macrofungi or also known as mushrooms is
 important and crucial initiative that should be done before the decline of the diversity of its species. Proper
 conservation and preservation technique is imperative in this kind of undertakings. The effective and
 systematic gene banking is very important not only among researches but also among local communities,
 students and stakeholders in acquiring these resources with valid data and information for proper
 utilization in the future. A book illustration of the mushrooms that will be collected will also be generated to
 popularize the existing mushroom species to be collected, including their structure, used and importance
 in medicine, as food and its importance in nature.",CLSU,Main

 which are in turn are widely accepted as the cause of anthropogenic climate change. This is a global
 problem which can be addressed through mitigation techniques such as energy efficiency enhancement,
 switching to inherently low-carbon fuels, and deployment of radical technologies such as CO2 capture
 and storage (CCS). Nevertheless, implementation of low-carbon energy systems must take into account
 various constraints such as cost and robustness. Process systems engineering (PSE) provides an
 appropriate framework for the optimal design and operation of such energy systems. These PSE tools,
 which can be based on strategies such as pinch analysis or mathematical programming, need to take
 into account specific technical issues pertaining to each low-carbon technology. For example, biomass
 feedstocks are subject to seasonal and geographic variations in supply, and may be vulnerable to
 climate change effects. Likewise, the viability of CCS is dependent on temporal and spatial issues (i.e.,
 time of availability and storage capacity of geological sites for CO2 storage). Thus, it is necessary for
 
 systematic PSE strategies to be developed in order to aid in decision support for the eventual large-scale use of such technologies",DLSU,Main
"Development and Application of Transport Desirability Index for the Assessment and Planning of Transport Systems in the Philippines
 
 Project Components:
 1. Criteria development for transportation desirability
 2. Software development (for data collection, data processing, analysis and presentation)
 3. Data collection (via surveys and data mining), modeling and analysis
 4. Capacity building to partner local universities and LGU's","Biona, Jose Bienvenido Manuel B.","The proposed project is about the development, testing, and introduction of a novel transportation desirability
 assessment tool for Philippine cities. Metro Manila, Baguio, Dagupan and Iloilo will be initial test cases.
 Various sectors are expected to have varying views on what makes transport desirable. While households in
 general may only be concerned with mobility experience and cost, the government may adopt a wider view taking
 into account external impacts such as environmental degradation and energy security among others. Transport
 experience and external impacts is a function of the where the people live vis-a-vis their common destinations (eg.
 work, schooling, market and shopping centers, etc.), transport mode availability and their capacity to access these
 modes. The tool that will be developed marries and process these components to provide a flexible platform to
 assess transport desirability based on different lenses.
 The proposed methodology will be household-based. Previous literature and Philippine-based studies have mostly
 focused on transport network based assessments and low resolution origin-destination analysis and none has
 looked at in detail the transport desirability of households and social groups across a geographical area. A
 household-based analysis would have plenty of advantages. First and foremost, the location of the affected
 population would be better identified. Second, equity and accessibility in transportation can be better assessed.
 And third, since the people could be identified, greater socio-economic detail may be employed in the study,
 allowing the impacts to be assessed separately for people of different ages, gender, income brackets, and
 residential areas. One of the major deliverables of the project is the development of a software tool to be used in
 data gathering and data management and implementation of the proposed assessment. This is targeted to be
 provided for free to local government units and agencies to aid in their planning and strategizing initiatives.
 The transportation desirability tool is targeted to be both a diagnostic and assessment tool, to guide assessment
 of proposed transportation policies and infrastructure. Being implemented in a GIS platform, it can be used for
 diagnostic purposes by identifying specific zones which require some form of transport policy/infrastructure
 intervention. As for assessment, its platform can also be used to visualize the potential impacts of a new project
 on a GIS map.
 The general objective of the project is to develop a household-based transport desirability assessment model and
 tool to aid local government units and researchers in identifying areas which badly need transport interventions,
 and in visualizing impacts of proposed projects in a GIS map. Specifically, it would involve the following:
 Develop criteria for transport desirability assessment, explaining conceptual justification and adopted
 perspective.
 Develop a software for data gathering and data management, to aid in the conduct of surveys needed in
 the modeling.
 Develop a software for implementing the transport desirability assessment model, and visualize the results
 (qualities and indicators) in a GIS platform.
 Perform multicriteria analysis with local experts to consult on the aggregation of indicators.
 Conduct capacity building workshops with partner universities, local government units and development
 institutions to disseminate the outputs of the research.
 Criteria development seeks to finalize and calibrate the assessment framework shown in Figure 1. It will be
 evaluated in terms of completeness, and conceptual justification. Afterwards, a full-criteria will be proposed and
 indicators will be designed putting into consideration data availability in the Philippines. It will be introducing
 composite indicators (i.e. efficiency, environmental impact, resilience, accessibility and social equity) in addition
 to individual qualities (e.g. number of person-km, cost, etc.). The main difference is that each indicator will be a
 combination of two or more qualifies, like in the way efficiency will be the ratio of trip distance and generalized
 cost Instead of merely reporting cost, travel time and person-km individually, the assessment will be reporting
 them altogether as efficiency. This makes the problem easier to understand. For example, high cost can trigger a
 multitude of problems These are potential problems which cannot be revealed by simply reporting its value (the
 cost). To make it easier for planners and researchers to understand the effects of high cost, indicators may be
 used instead of qualities. With high travel cost, the efficiency, accessibility, resilience and social equity of
 transportation to different people can be affected ‚Äî maybe not all at the same time, or not at the same degree, but
 that is for the model to answer. The development of the criteria will be assisted by existing collaborations of De La
 Salle University with Oxford University, UK and University College London, UK.
 Further, the software development component pertains to an app-based tool to be used in data collection surveys,
 and to a 015-based tool to be used in data processing and presentation of results. The tools should make adoption
 of the developed methodology easier for non-academics.
 
 The primary means of data collection in the study will be household and location surveys. An external contractor
 will be employed to perform household surveys, using the developed data collection app. They will also be
 surveying random people in identified key destinations in the city, such as malls, transit stations and university
 areas. Afterwards, other essential data such as population statistics, will be mined in local references. The
 preferred data analysis is household-based.
 With regards to aggregation of various indicators to assess transport desirability, a multicriteria analysis will be
 performed, possibly using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to obtain priority scores for the indicators from
 experts and stakeholders.
 Finally, capacity building will be performed via two separate workshops. The first will be training partner local
 universities on how to perform the same analysis in their own cities using the tools developed. The second will be
 training the local government agencies on how the tool can potentially help them in their planning and evaluation
 activities.
 The expected output is a software with full capabilities of data collection and assessment for transport desirability.
 The said tool will be made downloadable for free in an online portal. The software will be introduced and offered
 in two capacity building workshops.
 The expected outcomes will be initial transport desirability case studies of Metro Manila and of the partner
 universities' cities ‚Äî Baguio, Dagupan and Iloilo. In the long term, the project proponents hope to widen the usage
 of the tool to more users and cities, to improve the tool further. The tool is envisioned to improve the transport
 policy and infrastructure planning activities in the country.
 Intellectual Merit of the Study
 An initial review of related literature reveals that there is a lack of conceptual justification for existing project
 assessment approaches. The study aims to propose criteria with a balance of performance, sustainability and
 equity considerations. These criteria will be a novel contribution to literature worldwide.
 In addition, as mentioned earlier, local studies have focused on network-based and feasibility analysis studies and
 none has adopted a comprehensive household-based methodology to provide more information on the affected
 population, so their transportation and accessibility needs may be better addressed.
 Impact on Higher Education
 The proposed study boasts on interdisciplinary mentoring of both undergraduate and graduate students.
 Transportation is one of the most interdisciplinary fields, covering human behavior, economics and engineering.
 With this project, we are involving information technology ‚Äî developing software tools to add efficiency and quality
 to the assessment. The use of software tools would also make the adoption easier for none academics in the
 planning practice. The project will also provide an excellent service learning experience for involved students. The
 interdisdplinarity of the project is summarized in Table 1. While there are no principal investigators on this project
 from a pure economics and social science background, the current investigators have sufficient experience to
 work on these two disciplines, and the proposed budget has provisions for academic linkages and consultations
 to support this need.",DLSU,Main

 are big adjustments we need to take, but these changes are meant to make our willpower
 stronger, and love for each other deeper,‚Äù (PIA La Union, 2020).
 In response to the governor‚Äôs call for embracing the health minimum standards as a way of
 life, availability of inexpensive or low-priced organic hand soap which could be comparable to
 the commercial hand soap in the market must be commercially produced. Production of
 seaweed hand soap could benefit the faculty, staff and students of the Don Mariano Marcos
 Memorial State University with three Campuses and three Institutes strategically located in
 Bacnotan, Balaoan ,City of San Fernando, Agoo, Sto. Tomas and Rosario, La Union with a total
 number of 20,520 individuals that will be provided for three months.
 Studies showed that seaweed produces metabolites aiding in the protection against
 different environmental stresses. These compounds show antiviral, antiprotozoal, antifungal, and
 antibacterial properties (Perez, MJ., et.al. 2016.) Further, Saabani, et.al. (2019) revealed that
 seaweed extracts particularly the combination of Sargassum and Eucheuma was the most
 effective antibacterial formulation, as evidenced by the greatest mean zone of inhibition,
 effective 12 hours more compared with the commercial product.
 The cheaper alternative organic hand soap with brand name Seabon to be produced is a
 product of research of the University. It is made from seaweed and papaya extracts mixed with
 coconut and scented essential oils. It was subjected for chemical and microbial analyses by the
 Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care. The product has acquired a Utility

Sentiments Analysis on Public Land Transportation Infrastructure in Region XI using Machine Learning Algorithms,"Buladaco, Mark Van M.;Buladaco, Jumar S.;Cantero, Laarni M.","Land transport infrastructure has been a vital part of a city. People nowadays use social media to post their sentiments towards developments in a city such as land transport. Government agencies have difficulty in identifying issues that arises from the people using social media towards land transport infrastructure.

Along with this, adaptive capacity of students and faculty members was determined by collecting data on the availability of electricity, television, transistor radio (AM/FM), and availability of Internet Connection at home. Moreover, the type of Internet connection used for virtual learning and teaching, devices available to use for learning and teaching, status of Internet connectivity, and experienced learning modality were also described. With the initiative of the College's administration to provide its own Learning Management System (LMS), the details on the usage of LMS, features of LMS used, LMS and other platforms utilized with teachers during synchronous asynchronous sessions were also determined. Results revealed that utilizing television and transistor radio devices on blended learning may not be effective due to a huge number of learners who will not be able to access learning materials delivered through these media. Moreover, 45%of the students described not having Internet connection at home. Yet, on the status of Internet connectivity, only 67 learners have no Internet access in their area. There were also 14 faculty members who revealed not having Internet Connection at home, but was able to gain access as they go to school following the physical duty schedules.

Utilizing descriptive statistics, the results presented the learning barriers emerging such as inaccessibility of Internet connection and unavailability of devices necessary to use in the prescribed learning platforms. These students remained resilient by continuously participating in online class activities and complying with their course requirements. Though there were those who answered that they do not have Internet connection at home, the 68 sampled students did not answer no connection available at all, which means that they did find ways to connect to the web, in every possible way. With the unrelenting wills of these learners to continue their studies, it is therefore suggested that there should be constant monitoring of their participation in blended classes and find other alternatives of delivering instruction with low to no Internet connection.

Examples of protective resemblance are discussed for filefishes (family Monacanthidae) that only alter their color to match their benthic environment but enhance the deception by having filaments or flaps from the skin, and by their behavior. The species, Acreichthys tomentosus (Linnaeus 1758) effectively uses all these guises and found to be superior in remaining undetected, whether in its usual seagrass environment or adjacent sand, algal or coral zones. The juveniles of the filefish are remarkably well hidden in benthic algae of several species, most are recruitment site. Adults and sub-adults are most often seen in seagrass beds, mostly in Enhalus acoroides where they match the color and amount of epiphytic growth on seagrass. The filefish not only change its color pattern to match its immediate environment but it is also able to instantly change the texture of its skin, including producing of dermal filaments a few mm in length. Moreover, the sleeping behavior, mutualism of Seagrass and filefish are also featured in this paper.",DNSC,Main

Market Survey on the Production of Ornamental Freshwater Fish in Panabo City,"Saligan, Rosario B.;Manuales, Zoilyn B.;Turno, Rey B.","A market survey on the production of ornamental freshwater fish (OFF) in Panabo City was conducted from September 2016 to August 2017. The project aimed at finding the marketability of ornamental freshwater fish in Panabo City. Specifically, it determined the species of ornamental freshwater fish cultured and the volume of production assessed the means of selling and determined the number of persons engaged in OFF business. The study was conducted in 40 barangays of Panabo City but only nine barangays have persons engaged in the breeding, rearing, buying and selling of ornamental freshwater fish. A total of 21 entrepreneurs from the nine barangays served as respondents of this study. The species cultured ranged from an expensive arowana to the common fish, the molly. The monthly volume of production was classified as breeders, juvenile, fingerlings and fry. Production is usually high in the fingerling stage and correspondingly decrease as it grows to become breeders. The selling price of the ornamental freshwater fish depends on the species/strain and the size or stage of the fish. The breeders command the highest price and the fry is the lowest. The ornamental freshwater fish were marketed to the walk-in buyers, the whole sellers, the online buyers and the hobbyists/collectors. The OFF entrepreneurs advertise their OFF products by placing a tarpaulin signage, contact buyers through oral communication, and advertise it online. Based on the results of the market survey, it shows that ornamental freshwater fish business in Panabo City is profit able.",DNSC,Main

Security Framework for DNSC Web Site User Authentication,"Masagnkay, Rogelio A.;Delos Reyes, Ian Val P.;Padios, Ian Jay T.","Authentication in any organization is imperative. Although there are many forms of authentication that has been introduced, still text-based password is used due to its simplicity and uses can immediately access the resoruces. However, password has limitations such as being vulnerable to brute force and dictionary attach. That is why organization, it is encourage that their users strengthen their password by adhering to the password policies. Hence. a password must satisfy a minimum length and must contain lower case letters, upper case letters, digits and symbols (LUDS). Long and complext pasword makes the password strong and yield high entropy that is difficult to guess. But as password increases in length and complexity, the probability of mistakes also increases due to the users forgetting their passwords. Therefore tradeoff exist between password security and usability. In this research, random characters were appended to create complex password with high entropy and yet easy to remember (usable). Another method that was considered is to secure password securely. That is instead of sorting the plain text password, the hash of the password is stored in the database. But this kind of techniques is also vulnerable to rainbow table attack by comparing the pre-computed hash to the hash of the password. In order to prevent hackers from creating rainbow table, a random nu,ber known as salt was appended to the password, either at the beginning or ta the end. But again, due to adavancement of technology where computere can now process billions of passwords per second, passwords can still be guessed weven with the use of salt. This research, therefore, created a method that will help users create a password that is both strong and usable (40 characters in length containings LUDS but easy to remember), and generate a uniqe, random, and cryptographic salt for every password and then concatenate the salt value into a password randomly that is difficu;t to guess. This method will make the password more secure and resistant to any attack.",DNSC,Main

Study aimed to determine which predictors significantly influenced the licensure examination for teachers (LET) and licensure examination for fisheries technologist (LEFT) result. Quantitative research design was employed and 337 LET takers and 62 LEFT takers from DNSC from 2015- 2019 were investigated. The study used entrance test score, academic performance, and LET and LEFT results. Data were treated using frequency, Spearman‚Äôs correlation, and binary logistic regression. Result revealed that majority of LET takers entered teacher education got an average entrance test score and very good academic performance, while LEFT takers entered the Bachelor of Science in Fisheries got an average entrance test score and good academic performance. Study revealed that 89.9% of the LET takers passed the exam and 35.5 % of LEFT takers passed the examination. Study confirmed that there was a weak, positive monotonic correlation between entrance test score and LET and entrance test score and LEFT Results. It is also revealed that the academic performance and LET result has a weak, positive monotonic correlation and the academic performance and LEFT Results has a weak, positive monotonic correlation. It is concluded that of the two variables, statistically, only the admission test score has the likelihood to influence the LET results and LEFT results. Study suggested that schools offering Teacher Education Program and BS Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences to consider accepting students with high admission test score since study confirmed that for every 1-point increase of the admission test score, the likelihood that the LET and LEFT average score increase by approximately 2.

A descriptive survey was implemented to forty-three (43) members of Ata Mandaya tribe selected through purposive sampling. Then the responses were tabulated, quantified, and analyzed. This study aimed at assessing the IP communities in Panabo City, Davao del Norte in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, political structure, and DRM practices (issues and traditional knowledge). Also, this assessed the hazards, exposures, and vulnerabilities in the area. Lastly, the researchers recommended disaster management measures that could be of great help for LGU of Panabo City in integrating DRR policies into programs for the welfare of indigenous people. The study revealed that the IP community is considered vulnerable in terms of social, economic, physical, and ecological contexts. They are prone to different hazards in the community like floods, landslides, fire, banana spray, and the spread of coronavirus. The disaster risk management practices were assessed based on the four thematic areas of disaster risk management namely: prevention and mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, and rehabilitation. Accordingly, they had practiced both indigenous and conventional disaster risk reduction and management to remain resilient and adaptive despite varying natural and anthropogenic disasters affecting their community. However, some of these disaster management practices were slowly eroded over time due to some reasons like the technological development, integration of the IP members with non-IP members, and loss of interest of young IP generations to adopt and assimilate such practices.",DNSC,Main

Formulation and Process Optimization of Cavendish Banana (Musa acuminata) Candy,"Tabinas, Ria Jayne A.;Besas, Jesebel R.;Esprela, Liezel T.;Rodriguez, T.;Torrejos, Sevetrim B.;Micabani, Neal Reggie","Davao del Norte has been regarded as the Philippines' Banana Capital, wherein Cavendish is the leading variety that is grown for exportation. As standards for these are high, a considerable amount often does not meet these standards hence, posing food wastage problems. With the heightened importance of food security and sustainability, there is a need to utilize and add value to these substandard bananas grown, especially by local farmers. In this study, Cavendish banana was transformed into candy using a 7 variable 8-run screening methodology to identify variables that can influence its quality. Variables evaluated were sugar, carboxymethylcellulose, butter, citric acid, cornstarch, cooking time, and shape. Responses measured were sensory acceptability using a 9-point hedonic scale, water activity, moisture content, total soluble solids, and titratable acidity. Statistical analysis revealed that sugar and carboxymethyl cellulose significantly affected the candy positively, whereas high levels of butter and cornstarch and cube-shaped candy negatively affected the sensory acceptability. In terms of water activity, all variables except sugar provided a significant effect. For total soluble solids, only citric acid and cooking time did not have a significant effect. pH is significantly affected by all variables, and moisture content was significantly affected by sugar, CMC, cooking time, and shape. Overall, it is the level of white sugar and CMC that provided the most significant effect on the product's quality parameters. It is recommended that these will be further subjected to optimization studies such as Response Surface Methodology to optimize their levels.",DNSC,Main

The association between reef fishes and coral species are very important in the structure and functions of ecosystems. A study on the association of reef fishes with Acropora, Millepora, and Pocillopora was conducted at Marine Reserve Park, Samal Island, Philippines on May 2017 to identify the species composition of reef fishes and compare their species abundance, biomass, size and diversity. Observations were performed using SCUBA through Fish Visual Census. A total of 20 reef species belonging to seven families were identified with Acropora having the highest species richness. Millepora had significantly higher in abundance (130.3 individuals/colony) than Acropora (48 individuals/colony) and Pocillopora (19 individuals/colony) but they are not significant different in terms of biomass. Millepora had reef fishes that are significantly smaller in mean size (2.7 cm) than Acropora (4.9 cm) and pocillopora (4.6 cm). These corals provide habitats for both adult and juvenile pomacentrids. However, Millepora provided habitat and protection for very small juvenile with size 2.0 to 4.0 cm. The varying length frequency of C. viridis in different coral genera suggests for a habitat shift as they grow in size., hence they moved from Millepora to Acropora",DNSC,Main

Assessing the Status of Giant Clams and Advancing Culture Techniques Project 3: Evaluating the Status of giant clams in Mindanao,"Gumanao, Girley S.;Edullantes, Christine Mae A.","Giant clam assessment surveys in the Philippines are mainly focused in Luzon, Visayas and in small portion in Northern Mindanao leaving Southern Mindanao unrepresented. Thus, evaluating the status of giant clams in selected sites of Southern Mindanao was investigated from May 2018 to March 2021 to assess the giant clam biodiversity, recruitment at or near restocking sites and conduct information dissemination. Field assessment surveys were supplemented with Focus Group Discussion to understand local perceptions, threats and practices. Information Education Campaigns materials were produced and conservation activities were conducted to promote giant clam conservation. Surveys revealed that all (8) giant clam species recorded in the Philippines can be found in Mindanao of which 6 species are found in both Tawi-Tawi and Samal Island. The newly resurrected species, Tridacna noae was found across sampling sites while wild Hippopus species were exclusively found in Tawi-Tawi and it is locally extinct in Samal Island. Most of the giant clams can be seen from shallow portion of the reefs except for Tridacna squamosa that is widely spread across depths. The density of Giant Clams in Samal Island (338¬±93.6 ind/ha) is not significant different from Tawi-Tawi (588¬±170 ind/ha) (P<.05). Most abundant species in Samal Island was Tridacna squamosa and Tridacna maxima in Tawi-Tawi. The shell length of giant clams inside MPAs was bigger than those outside MPAs. The restocked T. gigas and T. derasa were only found Samal Island and Camiguin. The presence of T. gigas and T. derasa recruits, near restocking sites and in-situ spawning observations in Samal Island may indicate that restocked clams are now able to supply larvae to adjacent reef areas. In restocking sites in Mindanao emerged sustainable ecotourism and livelihood opportunities for coastal communities (e.g., Taklobo Tours in Samal Island). These highlights the indispensable role of MPAs in giant clam conservation. Despite these bright spots, giant clams in Mindanao are still facing serious threats as poaching, selling and collection for local consumptions are widely observed.

Economic Analysis Of Waste-To-Energy Investment In The Philippines: A Real Options Approach,"Agatona, Casper Boongaling;Gunoc, Charmaine Samala;Villanuevad, Resy Ordona;Villanuevad, Riza Ordona","Waste-to-energy technologies start to gain the attention of developing countries as a sustainable energy source in response to the worsening municipal solid waste management problem. This paper proposes an investment model to analyze the economic feasibility of waste-to-energy projects in developing countries using the Philippines as a case study. Applying the real options approach under uncertainty, we compare the option values, the value of waiting, and the optimal timing of switching technologies from landfill to waste-to-energy. Considering the energy production and investment costs, the optimization results find that incineration, with an optimal electricity price of USD 3cents/KWH, is the best technology option followed by gasification and pyrolysis at USD 7cents/KWH and USD 12cents/KWH, respectively. At the current price of electricity of USD 11cents/KWH, it is more optimal to postpone investment in pyrolysis, otherwise, the tipping should be increased from USD 15/ton to USD 18.5/ton to make pyrolysis a more viable option than continue using the landfill. On the other hand, it is a more optimal decision to invest immediately in either incineration or gasification as delaying investment incurs opportunity losses from generating electricity from these technologies. Furthermore, the paper suggests that the government must support waste-to-energy program as it will significantly contribute in solving the problems on the environment particularly air quality and waste management as well as on energy security and sustainability.",MinSU,Calapan

In this study, we isolated 17 strains from induced mortality events in healthy wild-caught blue mussel adults and demonstrated that they caused between 17% and 98% mortality in blue mussel larvae in a newly developed, highly controlled immersion challenge test model. Eight of the isolates belong to the Splendidus clade of vibrios, while the other isolates belong to the genus Photobacterium. The genomes of the most virulent Vibrio isolate and the most virulent Photobacterium isolate were sequenced and contained several genes encoding factors that have previously been linked to virulence towards bivalves. In vitro tests confirmed that all 17 isolates were positive for these virulence factors. The sequenced genomes also contained a remarkably high number of multidrug resistance genes. We therefore assessed the sensitivity of all isolates to a broad range of antibiotics and found that there were indeed many strong positive correlations between the sensitivities of the isolates to different antibiotics.

"Socio Economic Profile And Extent Of Marketing Strategies Of Different Fruit Growers In Victoria, Oriental Mindoro, Philippines","Zamora, Jesse T.;Agutaya, Christian Anthony C.;Cabaral, Nora C.;Atienza, Kenneth J.","The study was conducted to characterize and evaluate the different demographic characteristics and marketing strategies in relation to 7Ps of 354 fruit growers (i.e. babana, durian, lanzones, mangostene and rambutan) at Victoria, Oriental Mindoro, Phililippines using stratified random sampling. All data was analyzed using descriptive-correlation and descriptive-comparative methods.
 Majority of fruit growers are on the middle age group, more males and married individuals, and did not finish primary education. Fruit growers usually owned, managed and supervised 1-2 ha of land, had the most number of lanzones trees in their orchards, grow fruits within 5 to 10 years, commonly use grafting as a planting method to enhance high quality and quantity of production, and prefer to pack enormous fruit products as one of their post-harvest practices in fruit growing.
 Fruit growers employ diverse extent of marketing strategies related to the product, price, promotion, place, public, physical evidence and process. They allow consumers to taste their fruit products, prefer prices on their products which are very affordable and suitable to the consumers with regards on their purchasing power. However, they believe that they spent too much money on transporting and delivering their fruit products in the target place. The consuming public are more aware on the nature of the fruit business by the fruit growers. In relation to facilities, fruit growers maintain their facilities and equipment on harvesting their fruit products and always inspect if there is an unwanted surplus and damage on their fruit products.
 In general, results showed significant correlation between the different fruit growers profile and the extent of marketing strategies of fruit growers in relation to the 7Ps as indicators. Results revealed that product had the highest correlation (P<0.05; r=0.95) on the innovation used by fruit growers while absence of correlation was observed between product, gender and years in growing fruits. On the other hand, promotion indicates a significant and high correlation (P<0.01; r=0.91) on the farm size while no correlation on the civil status of the fruit growers. Price had a highly significant correlation (P<0.01) to the educational attainment (r=0.99) and type of fruit products produced and marketed by fruit growers (r=0.96). Place has significant and high correlation (P<0.01) on the type of fruit products produced and marketed by fruit growers (r=0.88) and their age (r=0.86). Public indicates a high correlation (P<0.01) on the civil status of the fruit growers (r=0.86) and age (r=0.83). Physical evidence showed a moderate to high correlation (P<0.01) to the years in growing fruit products by the growers while process shows a highly significant (P<0.01) and high correlation to the fruit growers gender.
 Findings provide further evidence that the mechanisms which the extent of marketing strategies using the 7Ps as indicators have a great influence on the fruit grower‚Äôs profile and vice versa. Results revealed that there is a significant difference between the product and public; product and physical evidence; product and process; promotion and public; promotion and physical evidence; price and place; price and public; price and physical evidence; place and public; and place and physical evidence (P<0.05) while the rest mean differences showed not significant differences (P>0.05). Findings suggest that the extent of marketing strategies of fruit growers which is offered to the consumers in the market were very diverse.",MinSU,Main

Evidence Of Shape Sexual Dimorphism In Strombus Luhuanus Linnaeus 1758 (Gastropoda: Strombidae),"Sanchez-Escalona, Katherine;Me√±ez, Marie Antonette Juinio","Sexual size dimorphism of Strombus luhuanus was explored with Geometric Morphometrics. Using 39 landmarks and semi-landmarks, principal component analysis (PCA) showed possible separation of sexes with significant loadings on shoulder and the inner lip. Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) cross-validated classification showed males and females can be identified using the generated shape variables with 83.72% and 71.43% accuracy respectively. Examination of the generated mean shape showed that males are slimmer while females are more bulbous with vector changes along the inner lip and shoulder. Sexual shape may be related to differential energy allocation of reproduction with males spending more on finding a mate and females devoting more on egg production.

Ecosystem-Based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-Drr) Assessment Tool For Mangrove Ecosystem Services,"Quitain, Randy A.","The Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR) Framework focuses on managing, restoring, and conserving the environment for the purpose of integration in the Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) program. The leaders and managers around the world utilized the intrinsic services provided by the ecosystem as reinforcement to reduce the impact of disaster brought by natural hazards. However, in spite of their significance in superseding disastrous natural events and policies protecting them, anthropogenic activities continually exploit the resources of the environment for development. This turns out that the challenge of this approach in DRR program is the insufficiency of techniques to measure and describe the intervention done by a specific ecosystem to reduce the damage of natural hazards and for humans to realize its importance. In this case, the study formulated an assessment tool to measure the value of one of the most exploited biomes globally, the mangrove ecosystem. The assessment tool concentrated on the DRR services of the studied ecosystem using two (2) types of approaches: a) the Ecological Assessment; and, b) Social (Community) Assessment. These approaches contain different parameters to be used as DRR evaluation instrument and their implementations are guided by the proposed assessment framework for Eco-DRR. This framework serves as a guide in the selection of parameters in the formulation of the Eco-DRR Assessment Tool for Mangrove Ecosystem Services. After the selection of the parameters to be used both for Ecological and Social Assessment, these were grounded in the study site to test their reliability, compatibility, and accuracy before and after data collection. Moreover, the formulated assessment tool was reviewed by the experts working in mangrove ecosystem and related disciplines incorporated in the study. The process and data collection during the pre and post testing were analyzed and discussed to understand their significance in the creation of Eco-DRR assessment tool for the target ecosystem. Finally, the substantial parameters were selected to be included in the final draft of the Eco-DRR tool. The Eco-DRR tool showed promising results after testing it in the selected study site. Each parameter provided data that can reflect the significant role of the mangroves in terms of climate change mitigation, prevention of coastal erosion, tsunami or extreme tidal wave energy reduction, flood or storm surge barrier, and biodiversity protection. These interventions are connected to the different frameworks working in Ecosystem-based Solution similar to the Sendai Framework. The results and analyses of the parameters proved their relevance in managing the impact of natural disasters through their application and relationship to the Sendai Framework. Later in the analysis, the parameters used to evaluate the DRR capacities of mangroves are consolidated to comprise the ‚ÄúEcosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR) Assessment Tool for Mangrove Ecosystem Services‚Äù as fulfilment to the core objective of this study.",MinSU,Bongabong

This study assessed the role of women in household decision-making around farming and livelihood activities and climate change adaptation utilizing weather and climate information. Quantitative data collection through face to face interview was conducted in 324 rice farming household respondents in Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. Descriptive statistical analysis was applied to assess the role of women in household decision-making. Results show that the majority of women (59%) already participate in almost all the decisions. The husband considers his wife as an influencer and partner in the decision making and allows his wife to take the lead and have an input in almost all the decisions in some of the activities. Women are powerful in deciding routine household purchases and food preferences. Almost half of the household women (49%) participate in certain types of adaptation activities. They have input in most or all decisions when it comes to making houses more resilient to flooding and typhoon. However, there are a number of women who do not participate in decision-making. It is still the male who decides for almost all major household activities. To fully realize women empowerment and strengthen their participation and inputs in decisions, the study recommends policies and programs to improve women‚Äôs capacity and devote full representation in the decision-making process in planning and implementing agricultural-related programs integrating climate change adaptation utilizing weather and climate information.",MinSU,Main

Ecarte: An Interactive Restaurant Menu With Feedback Collection,"Romano, Kristian Andrew R.;Masilungan, Rheabel S.;Cacho, Ladelyn;Melendres, Uriel M.","The restaurant industry has grown over the years along with the modernization of technology. Like any other area of this industry, the menu presentation also demands improvement. Possessing smartphones proved to be a necessity nowadays and regular restaurant customers with their phones bring an opportunity to materialize the concept. The idea of accessing the restaurant menu through smartphones is new to a restaurant in Oriental Mindoro, Philippines. Hence, the proponents were motivated to develop the eCarte ‚Äì an interactive restaurant menu with feedback collection. The development of this system can improve the customer's experience which would be beneficial to the restaurant. Proponents used incremental development as a software development method to come up with an efficient system. The developed system is user-friendly and interactive. The customers will be able to see the actual picture of the dish with a short description, and other customers‚Äô reviews. Selected Information Technology Faculty, restaurant owners and customers evaluated the system. The five evaluation criteria used were adapted from ISO 25010 software quality standards. Based on the evaluation result, eCarte is usable and met its expected functions in terms of functional suitability (4.93), performance efficiency (4.88), usability (4.84), security (4.83), and maintainability (4.84). The system is generic, not expensive, easy to maintain and suitable to any smartphone regardless of its operating system which makes it applicable to any local restaurant. For further improvement, the proponent recommends applying an algorithm like the High Adjective Count algorithm and Max Opinion Score algorithm to effectively analyze the customer's feedback.",MinSU,Bongabong
"A Cross-Country Analysis Of Students‚Äô Evaluation Of University Teaching: Relationship Between Faculty Behavior, Student Satisfaction And Teaching Quality","Atif Hassan, Atif;Ghaffar, Abdul;Dinglasan, Enya Marie D.","There is an emergent global consensus that students‚Äô evaluation (feedback) of university teaching is fundamentally controversial. Few would argue that a system that tells the ‚Äúsatisfactory‚Äù teaching of faculty members could be biased, for example; lenient faculty behavior may get a high percentage of feedback and may compromise quality of teaching. Similarly strict behavior of faculty may get low percentage of feedback despite good quality of teaching. In this way, there is a possibility of relationship between quality of teaching and positive students‚Äô feedback. In order to examine the relationship between faculty behavior, student satisfaction and teaching quality, this study aimed to provide a cross-country analysis. The study employs focus group methodology. Focus group used in this research study has been operated under participant observation method. In each country (Pakistan, Philippines), in depth group interviews were conducted in two separate sessions, including focus group with students and faculty members. Four distinct focus group sessions were conducted to ensure the validity and reliability of the collected data. First stage of students‚Äô focus group inferred that a majority of the students like lenient teachers and they definitely give positive feedback if a faculty member gives less complicated and not so challenging assignments and other activities. They further stated that if a teacher remained strict throughout the class, students usually give a low score in their evaluation. Therefore, student feedback may not be an accurate reflection of the student satisfaction and is not a good indicator of effective teaching. In the second stage of faculty‚Äôs focus group, opinion of faculty is consistent with the view of student‚Äôs focus group discussion about lenient and strict faculty behavior and its relationship with students‚Äô satisfaction and teaching quality with few alterations. They further added that scale of students‚Äô feedback should be re-validated for more accuracy. Results showed a good consistency for both Pakistani and Philippines sample.",MinSU,Calapan
Teachers‚Äô Integration Of Environmental Awareness And Sustainable Development Practices,"Cabaral, Nora;Untalan, Hugo;Rieta, Prime Gilbert","A study was conducted to determine how different type of music influences the performance, egg quality, behavior and economics of raising Japanese quails. A total of 165 sexed day-old chicks was randomly assigned to five treatments and replicated three times with eleven quails (10 females and 1 male) per replication and was conducted from August to November, 2016. All data were subjected to ANOVA following the CRD and differences between treatments were subjected to Tukey‚Äôs Test. Analysis revealed that quails exposed with random music showed highly significant (p<0.05) final body weight, compared to quails provided with metallic, reggae and quails that was not provided with any kind of music but is similar with quails exposed with classical music. Quails exposed to random, metallic and reggae music had significantly higher (p<0.05) % hen-day production and are more efficient in converting feeds into dozen of eggs. Quails exposed to random and classical music had significantly higher (p<0.05) egg white weight, fertility and hatchability rate and had thicker shell. However, results revealed comparable egg yolk weight and yolk color regardless of types of music. Results showed that quails exposed with reggae music significantly improved eating habit and are less aggressive compared to quails provided with metallic music and quails not subjected with any kind of music but are comparable with the eating habit and aggressiveness of quails exposed with random and classical music while provision of different type of music did not trigger chirping and feather pecking among Japanese quails. The EFPR, net income and ROI of quails subjected to random and classical music was significantly higher. These results implies that provision of random and classical music increases egg production and improved FCR that consequently increases profit than the normal management practices in quails reared without any exposure to music.",MinSU,Main

 introducing a public utility vehicle (PUV) modernization program with electric jeepneys (e-jeepneys) and modernized diesel jeepneys. Despite its potential to address problems related to air pollution, traffc congestion, dependence on fuel imports, and carbon emissions, transport groups show resistance to the adoption of the government program due to costs and investment risk issues. This study aims to guide transport operators in making investment decisions between the modernized diesel jeepney and the e-jeepney fleet. Applying the real options approach (ROA), this research evaluates option values and optimal investment strategies under uncertainties in diesel prices, jeepney base fare price, electricity prices, and government subsidy. The optimization results reveal a better opportunity to invest in the e-jeepney fleet in all scenarios analyzed. Results also show a more optimal decision strategy to invest in the e-jeepney immediately in the current business environment, as delaying or postponing investment may incur opportunity losses.

 conditions, worsening pollution, poverty, hunger and malnutrition. Scientists are finding ways to solve these
 problems and one of the identified solutions is the utilization of edible insects as human food.
 The potential of insects as food to meet future global food demands has been explored, recognized and gained
 support from intemational organizations like the Centre Technique de Cooperation Rurale at Agricole (CTA) and the
 Food and Agricultural Organizations (FAO). In Thailand, insect farming and selling of insects for human food is
 already a multi-million industry. It provides income and employment as well as healthy and nutritious food to
 consumers.
 Utilization of edible insects as human food by Filipino people however, is far behind from other Asian countries.
 Entomophagy (eating insects) is rare and considered as a ""rurar or ""backward"" practice, born out of times of
 poverty and isolation from ""modem life."" Furthermore, majority of our farmers and government authorities have not
 seen its value for pest control in times of pest outbreak. Currently, pesticides still dominate among the
 various tactics advocated by Integrated Pest Management.
 In the Philippines, two insects are commercialized as feed for aquarium fishes such as arowanas and flowerhoms
 and for fighting cocks but never as human food. They are the mealworrns (Tenebrio molitor) and superworms
 (Zophobas mono) which are sold in large quantities in Cartimar Pet Center, Pasay City and in many parts of the
 country. Other cultures however, considered superworms as human food. They are reported to contain 58% protein
 along with vitamins, enzymes, hormones, and have other nutritional benefits. Its high protein content makes it the
 perfect raw material component that can be added into bread, pastry, instant noodles, and other foodstuffs. This

Water pollution and watershed deterioration are also concerns that must be looked into.This proposed research shall conduct an economic valuation of the Lake Sebu ecosystem in order to answer specific environmental policy questions: (1) What is the value of the total flow of benefits from the ecosystem; (2) What is the net benefit of interventions that aim to improve ecosystem conditions; (3) How are the costs and benefits of the ecosystem distributed; and, (4) Who can be potential implementers and financing sources for conservation.
 Methodology. The Total Economic Value (TEV) approach shall be the over-all analytical framework for the study. A resource's TEV consists of use and non-use values. Use values derived from a surface freshwater ecosystem include fishing income and other livelihood activities; viewing, swimming and other recreational activities; and water supply generation. Non-use values, on the other hand, refer to resource values that are independent of people's present use of the resource (eg: biodiversity and water quality). Different methods will be employed to estimate different benefits derived from Lake Sebu. Fishing and other types of income generated shall be measured with production (eg: predictive fish yield models developed by Moreau and De Silva 1991) and market demand functions. The travel cost method shall be employed to estimate the recreational use value of Lake Sebu while the contingent valuation method shall be employed to estimate non-use values. Expected output and outcomes. Estimates of benefits that can be derived from the ecosystem can serve as inputs to cost-benefit analyses of programs and policies on environment and resource protection and conservation, so that these programs may be adequately and appropriately pursued and implemented. One particular program or policy
 instrument that may be potentially effective in resource protection and conservation is the Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES). In PES, those who derive income and other forms of benefits from an ecosystem are made to
 financially reward those who undertake activities or forego income-earning activities to preserve the resource. A successful PES program requires TEV estimates of the ecosystem. Thus, TEV studies are particularly useful in regions where environmental degradation is increasingly becoming a problem. Findings from this research will be disseminated to concerned government officials and policy makers on the national (DENR, BEAR, NEDA, DOT, Philippine Senate and Congress) and local (provincial and city executive and legislative branches) levels. At least three journal (ISI/SCOPUS) articles are expected to result from this project. Target journals
 include Journal of Environmental Science and Management, Asian Development Review, Asian Journal of Water Environment and Pollution and Functional Ecology.
 Intellectual merit and expected impact on the scholarly community, industry and society This proposed project aims
 to develop capacity in environmental research with public program and policy advocacy component, particularly in
 the area of ecosystem valuation and conservation, among higher education institutions in the southern region of
 Mindanao. The intention is for the learning and experience to be gained from this collaboration between an
 experienced environmental economist from Ateneo de Manila University and the faculty and research staff of Notre
 Dame of Marbel University to spill-over to faculty and research staff of other colleges, universities and research
 institutes as well government (national and local) and non-government organizations, and be applied to other types
 of ecosystems. Their research findings are hoped to provide useful inputs and guides to public policy-making and
 public program design and implementation.",NDMU,Main

"Top Quark Studies and New Physics Searches in the Compact Muon Solenoid Experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider for Physics in Grade 12 STEAM
 
 Project Components:
 1. Experimental determination of the top quark's production cross section, either produced singly or by pair, and physical properties
 2. Study on supersymmetry based on final state signatures
 3. Study on new physics as predicted by the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) model and unparticle
 4. Development of learning modules on high energy physics and pilot-tested teaching modules on high energy physics","Palisoc, Caesar","We study the top quark's production and decay in proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider
 (LHC) of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. Specifically, we
 want to experimentally determine the top quark's production cross section, either produced singly or by pair,
 
 and physical properties, e.g. mass and lifetime, at the present center-of-mass (COM) energy of 14 Tera-
 electron-Volt (TeV) of the LHC. The existence of supersymmetry is similarly probed in this investigation through
 
 the top quark decays and its production in excess of the Standard Model predictions. We also study the
 production of exotic particles, which are an indication of new physics, as predicted by the Arkani-Hamed,
 Dimopoulos, and Dvafi (ADD) model and un-particle models. On the education side, leaming and teaching
 modules on high energy physics are developed.
 As a general principle, experimental calculation of production cross section depends on reaction rate and
 luminosity. The cross section is proportional to the interaction rate and inversely proportional with the luminosity.
 The reaction or event rate is the number of the desired final state particle that is scattered at a specified
 scattering angle and energy within a given period of time. The larger the event rate, the larger the cross section.
 Of course, the cross section is already determined or fixed by Nature. This event rate is determined by the
 detector of the experiment. How accurate the determination of the event rate will turn out depends on how
 efficient the detector is in counting a specific event. The efficiency of the CMS detector depends on how good
 the hadron calorimeter, muon and pixel detectors, tracker, trigger, and data acquisition systems are. The
 luminosity is a property of the machine or the collider. The higher the energy of the colliding beams are the
 larger the luminosity is. Likewise, the more focus the interaction region of the colliding beams are the higher
 the luminosity is. Increasing the luminosity means higher statistics and as a result more events are expected
 to be detected. The processes that the project is interested in to investigate includes the top quark pair
 production, where the W bosons, to which the pair of produced top quark couples, decay a) exclusively
 leptonically, e.g. via the e+ e- , p+ p-, e¬± p mode, and b) hadronically and leptonically, e.g. via the lepton +
 jets channel. It is interesting to study the production of a single top quark via the electreweek process, where
 the final state top quark couples with the initial state bottom quark and virtual W boson, as well. The project is
 likewise interested in the search for supersymmetry based on final state signatures involving a) hadronic jets
 and missing transverse momentum (MET), and b) a single, isolated, high-transverse-momentum electron or
 muon in association with energetic jets and large missing transverse momentum. The proposed study is equally
 interested in the search for new physics as predicted by the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) model
 and un-particle models via a process with final state involving a monojet and MET These measurements are
 to be undertaken at the LHC having a COM energy of 14 TeV and higher integrated luminosity using the CMS
 detector. The whole process of accessing raw data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment to
 analyzing them are shared to school learners, via their post-graduate physics teachers or learning modules, to
 allow these learners to appreciate the fundamental building blocks of nature more. Teaching modules on high
 energy particle collisions are likewise produced for the benefit of the post-graduate physics teachers teaching
 physics to Grade 12 classes. Both teaching and learning modules shall include hands-on analysis of raw data.
 Intellectual merit - On the physics side, the proposed study will help a) contribute to further constraining the
 top quark's properties of mass and decay width, and b) in determining the existence of new physics. On the
 education side, the proposed activity will help expose and equip both post-graduate and school learners in the
 practical rudiments of high energy physics enough to win them over and embark on a career in fundamental
 physics.
 Impact on higher education - By the end of the project's duration, we would have produced modules so that
 the minimum requirement of learners acquired expertise in analysis in experimental high energy physics and
 powerful computers would have been established for learners to possibly undertake research in high energy
 physics in the future. By the study's conclusion, the project would have widened the range of research areas
 of post-graduate science students may choose from.
 Wider impact - The consequence of our engagement with CMS through the proposed project will start placing
 the Philippines on the intemafional map of countries involved in High Energy Physics (HEP) at the LHC of
 CERN. The world acknowledges CERN to be the center of leading edge technology at the moment and for
 several decades to come. The Philippines participation in CERN through the proposed project will promote
 transfer of cutting edge technologies via frontier technology training in information technology for instance which
 represent 26% of technology transfer database of CERN's education and technology transfer (ETT) division.
 The Philippines initial engagement with the ETT division can come in the form of technology transfer through
 people by CERN hosting scientists, engineers and students through its many and varied schemes like
 Associateships, Fellowships, Doctoral and Technical studentships [J.A. Rubio, ""A Review of Technology
 Transfer at CERN', Proceedings of EPAC 2002, Paris, France.]. This form of technology transfer involvement
 may metamorphose in the future to CERN supported transfer technology projects, where HEP inspired
 technologies are expanded to promote useful applications in non-HEP areas tike health, electronics, and
 biotechnology, to name a few. Likewise, the study will allow the strengthening of the country's competency in
 analyzing large amount of data. These acquisitions of expertise may augment and complement our country's
 researches in other fields requiring analysis of huge amount of data, like in GRID computing and cloud
 formations in connection with disaster mitigation for example.",PNU,Main

Enhanced RC6 permutation-diffusion operation for image encryption.,"Aguila, Catherine Bhel B.;Sison, Ariel M.;Medina, Ruji P.","RC6 is considered one of the encryption strategies being utilized and modified to be suited for image protection. However, the RC6 encryption algorithm is still prone to statistical and differential attack which is one of the major concerns whenever open networks are to be used. In this paper, we proposed a modification of RC6 algorithm for image encryption. A new technique of permutation-diffusion architecture based on a modified concept of cyclic shift is integrated to increase the degree of permutation and diffusion mechanism of RC6 for image encryption. The security level, processing time and diffusion rate were tested using image evaluation metrics such as correlation coefficient test, number of pixel change rate (NPCR) test, unified average change intensity (UACI) test, and run-time analysis to measure its efficiency along with the simulation process. Results show that the proposed method illustrates a lower value of correlation among pixels and higher value of NPCR and UACI which makes the proposed method highly resistant to statistical and differential attacks.

These imbalances necessitate the need for plants to produce osmolytes including proline and glycine betaine. This study aimed to elucidate the dynamic changes in proline and glycine betaine accumulation modulated by the inoculation of Brevibacterium linens RS16 in salt-sensitive and moderately salt-tolerant rice plants under salt stress conditions. This study showed the interaction of four major factors including rice genotypes with differing tolerance to salt stress, length of exposure to salt stress, level of salt stress and effects of inoculation. Salt stress resulted in significant reduction in plant growth parameters with the salt-sensitive rice genotype (IR29) having a more significant growth reduction. Both the salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant rice genotypes increased in total proline and glycine betaine accumulation at 3 days and 10 days after subjecting under 50 mM and 150 mM salt stress conditions. A significant increase in proline and glycine betaine was observed in the salt-sensitive genotype after 10 days under 50 mM and 150 mM salt stress conditions. Inoculation of the rice genotypes with B. linens RS16 resulted in the improvement of plant growth parameters in both rice genotypes, and total proline and glycine betaine accumulation, especially in IR29. This study showed that proline and glycine betaine are compatible osmolytes of rice under salt stress, and that inoculation of rice genotypes with B. linens RS16 mediated salt tolerance through improvement of plant growth parameters and proline and glycine betaine accumulation in rice plants.",RSU,Main
Golden Apple Snail Meal as Protein Source for Siganus guttatus Culture,"Visca Jr., Miguel D.;Palla, Suzette","The golden apple snail (GAS) was introduced in the Philippines in 1980s as food for human and farm animals and later turned into a destructive invasive species especially in rice fields. The feasibility of the golden apple snail as an alternative protein source has been tested for tilapia, shrimp and prawn. This study determined the growth performance of rabbitfish, Siganus guttatus using GAS meal as protein source in terms of growth parameters, survival rates (SR), feeding efficiency and economic viability of formulated feeds used. The experiment consisted of four treatments (T1-control diet; T2-test diet with 15% CP; T3-test diet with 30% CP; T4-test diet with 45% CP) that was replicated three times over a period of 120 days. Each cage was stocked with 60 pcs fry and set up in a randomized completely block design. This study revealed that utilization of GAS meal with 45% crude protein (CP) as protein source for S. guttatus can replace or substitute fish meal for more than two months at a cheaper cost. For better results of formulated feeds, pre-mixed vitamins and minerals must be added.",RSU,Santa Fe
Teaching Competence and Attitude Towards the Teaching Profession of Senior High School Teachers: Education vs. Non-Education,"Wong, Jonathan P.","In an effort to help improve the quality of education and student performance, the Philippines has implemented the K12 program, which led to a mass hiring of teachers to teach in senior high schools. Since the guidelines in the selection and recruitment of senior high school teachers do not specify the need to employ education graduates much more a licensed teacher, the implementation of K12 program has generated doubts as to the quality and competence of these newly appointed teachers especially those who are a non-education graduate. In line with this pressing concern, the present investigation has shed light on the critical question as to whether there exists a significant difference in the teaching competence and attitude of these teachers. The sample of the study comprised of 95 education graduate and 29 non-education graduates from among the various senior high schools in the Division of Romblon, MIMAROPA region. Findings revealed the existence of a significant difference in all the teaching competence dimensions of education and non-education respondents with the education graduate group having the edge over those who are non-education graduates. Moreover, the education graduates manifested a more positive attitude towards the teaching profession than those non-education respondents. A significant relationship was also confirmed between the type of education obtained at the undergraduate level and the teaching competence of both groups of respondents. The study provides a general implication to DepEd officials to consider revisiting the guidelines in the selection and recruitment of senior high school teachers.",RSU,Sawang
"Karagatan Tropes, Maritime Characteristics and the Oral Tradition of Romblon","Perlas, Sherwin M.","Philippine regional oral literature scholarship is currently navigating against the current from the periphery to the center. While a number of works had been anthologized and had undergone scrutiny, apparently not much exploration has been given to the factor of geography, which has allowed the transport of multiculturalism and multilingualism as it is in Romblon. The main research question is a descriptive-analytic documentation of the tradition: the questions reflect on the textual-historical analysis of the significance of karagatan; the textual and extra-textual analysis of the people‚Äôs collective consciousness; and the overall contribution of the study to the present anthology of the Philippine National Literature.
 The history, geography, context of narration and culture were likewise recorded and the translation was done during fieldwork with the aid of the natives. The original vernacular text along with the transcribed and translated field texts were subjected to textual, extra-textual, historical, cultural, and geographical analyses with the researcher interpreting data from the informants‚Äô perspectives. 
 Interestingly, the fieldwork, translation, and literary analysis revealed several fascinating aspects of the regions‚Äô consciousness. The maritime characteristics of Romblon archipelago served not as a barrier but a link between the islands thereby connecting the people as one region, as one community. Though the people sang their songs in three different languages‚Äì Onhan, Asi, and Romblomanon- they talked of the same sea, laughed at the same jokes, shared the same value and in general, exhibited diverse but amalgamated attitudes and ideals.",RSU,Main

Dysfunctional Attitudes of Adolescents with Suicide Ideation and Intent,"Dalisay, Jun P.","Suicide is one of the alarming issues that need prompt and immediate action despite many preventive measures. This study described dysfunctional attitudes, suicide ideation and suicide intent. It also tested the relationships among the variables; and developed therapeutic approach. Mixed design particularly sequential mixed method was used. Purposive sampling was employed to 157 participants who are non-psychotic with suicide intent. Standardized tests were used to gather quantitative data and in-depth interview for qualitative analysis. Frequency, percentage, mean scores, rank, chi-square and Pearson r were utilized to analyse data. The study revealed that participants have mild dysfunctional attitudes with moderate suicide ideation and low suicide intent. They are emotionally vulnerable due to irrational beliefs and cognitions that defeat effective functioning. When faced negative life‚Äôs events, they have tendencies to commit suicide even though suicide intentions vary from low to high. Irrational beliefs among suicide adolescents must be restructured through counselling using Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT). Various programs and activities that can divert adolescent‚Äôs thoughts from ending life to experiencing a meaningful life may be initiated. Dysfunctional attitudes can affect suicide ideation and intent. It is deemed important
 for parents and teachers to be informed and trained on how to spot strange actions especially if the actions are too vague to conclude suicide tendencies. Qualitative analysis revealed emotional vulnerability, suicide tendencies and willingness to commit suicide thus, therapeutic approach for suicide adolescents was proposed",RSU,Main
Using Consensus in Instructional Decision-Making Improves Undergraduate Students' Attitude towards Biology,"Fetalvero, Eddie G.;Bagarinao, Ricardo T.;","The quality of science teaching the students experience is claimed to be the strongest influence in the development of positive attitude towards science, the sine qua non for its public appreciation. In this fully video-documented quasi-experimental study, the effect of using consensus in instructional-decision making on students' attitude towards Biology in undergraduate biological science class was tested. Covering the unit in bioenergetics, two classes were compared. One class was taught using conventional instruction while the other used the consensus process. In the consensus class, students raised an issue in the learning plan, negotiated, proposed an alternative, participated in a ‚Äògrand conversation', made decisions using consensus, and adhered to the agreed instructional activities. They were further grouped and were tasked to arrive at a consensus answer on a focus question related to the lesson discussed. Both classes were pre-tested and post-tested with the Attitude towards Biology Scale. Analysis of covariance showed that the intervention is effective in improving students‚Äô overall attitude towards Biology specifically in developing a positive perception of the biology teacher, improving keenness to learn Biology and enhancing enjoyment of the subject. Findings provide an empirical support on the use of consensus as an approach in instructional-decision making.",RSU,Main
Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) among Montforian Teachers: A Cross National Comparative Study in Asia,"Wong, Jonathan P.","While the link between Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) and organizational variables has been established, national cultures underlying this relationship and its influence remains poorlyunderstood in school organizations. This descriptive-correlational study measured OCB among teachers and tested its relationship with Perceived Organizational Support (POS) and Employee commitment to different cultures in Asia. The sample of the study comprised of 427 teachersfrom13 Montfortian schools among the five (5) Asian countries: Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and India. ANOVA along with Post Hoc, Correlation and Regression Analysis were conducted on the data collected through the survey method. This empirical study found significant differences in the organizational citizenship behaviors among teachers between Malaysia and Singapore. This current study also disclosed the significantrelationships between POS and Organizational Citizenship Behavior in the Philippines, Singapore and India. Further, it was found that normative commitment enhanced the relationship between POS and OCB directed toward Individuals (OCB-I). Significantly, affective commitment had full mediation through POS and OCB directed toward organization (OCB-O) in the Philippines while normative commitment partially mediated through POS and OCB-O in Singapore.",RSU,Sawang
"Tree Species Composition and Diversity and CALSANAG Watershed Forest Reserve, Tablas Island, Philippines","Lucidos, Juniel G.;Hernandez, Jonathan O.;Pulan , Dennis E.;Maldia, Lerma Sj.;","The complex geological and biogeographical history of Tablas Island, which belongs to the Romblon Island Group, and the ongoing illegal activities in the the area may have influenced the present condition of the island‚Äôs floral diversity. However, information about the flora of Tablas, particularly trees, is less common compared with the other plant groups/growth forms. Here the tree species composition and diversity in CALSANAG Watershed Forest Reserve on Tablas Island were assessed to provide implications for conservation. A 2-hectare permanent biodiversity monitoring area (PBMA) was established on the island and further divided into 200 plots, from which twelve plots were randomly selected. Ninety-four tree species belonging to 76 genera and 44 families were identified. Tablas Island has an average computed diversity value of 3.12 (i.e., high species diversity). Thirty species are Philippine tree endemics, of which eight species are potential new province records, and six species were threatened. This study should serve as baseline information that is important for the creation and implementation of conservation programs on the island. However, regular vegetation monitoring is highly recommended for a better understanding of the floral resources on the island using the established PBMA.",RSU,Main
Language Proficiency and Pedagoical Strategies in the English Language Classroom: Determinants of Preservice Teachers' Level of Self-Efficacy,"Sy, Donna Bel F.","Social Cognitive Theory explicates that teachers‚Äô effcacy beliefs shape the kind of environment that they create as they instill the culture of learning among their students (Bandura, 1977). Accordingly, every teacher education program offered in various colleges and universities aims to produce self-effcacious preservice teachers with high expectations that they can affect both the kind of context they build and the various pedagogical activities they present in the classroom. It is therefore the purpose of this study to determine the relationships among the perceived levels of preservice English-language teachers‚Äô self-effcacy beliefs, language profciency, and pedagogical strategies. Findings revealed that the respondents have a moderate level of self-effcacy beliefs, and this is signifcantly associated to their speaking profciency. Results also showed that their classroom management is linked to their writing self-effcacy; whereas, their communicative strategies are correlated to classroom and outcome effcacy.

The Potential of Mango Starch and Snake Fibers as Bio-Plastic,"Blancia, Garry Vanz","Starch is cheap and very widely available natural resources that makes an excellent biodegradable plastic product that can be readily manufactured on existing processing with no modification. The aim of this research is to know the potency of mango seed starch and snake plant fibers as bio-plastic fillers and glycerol concentration as plasticizer on tensile strength and elongation at break, density, and heat resistance. The samples prepared have three treatments and a control group containing different measurements of the materials. The citric acid addition improves the shelf-life of the material and improves the mechanical properties. The average thickness of the bio-plastics is 0.001 m. The average heat resistance content is 96.7 √°¬µ?C. Meanwhile, the water uptake is 33.3%. The average density of bio-plastic wass found to be 1.19 g/cm¬≥.

This paper highlights the results of a study conducted from April to December 2019, which assessed the state of natural resources management in Barangay Mari-norte, San Andres, Romblon, which is part of the CALSANAG (Calatrava, San Andres, and San Agustin) Watershed. Biophysical characterization was done to determine land use and biodiversity, while farm household survey was administered to 133 farmers to characterize their socioeconomic conditions. Results showed that all of the farmer-respondents were engaged in the production of tiger grass (Thysanolaena maxima Roxb), where most of the farm households derived an estimated annual income of >Php50,000. Although their household income is higher as compared to other upland farming communities in the Philippines, most of them expressed that their income is insufficient since tiger grass is harvested only once a year, and the farmers have no alternative sources of income. On the other hand, biophysical characterization revealed the following: the farms are generally rainfed, have rolled to steep slopes, and have indications of low soil fertility, soil erosion incidence, and very low level of biodiversity (0.92). Most of the farmers practiced ""slash-and-burn"" to cultivate tiger grass as a single crop and hence, the forest cover has declined. A multi-agency collaboration jointly initiated agroforestry promotion in the upland farming communities through capability-building of upland farmers in agroforestry and establishment of tiger grass-based agroforestry model which showcases the economic and ecological viability of agroforestry systems in CALSANAG Watershed.",RSU,Main

Optimization of Straight-Bladed Darieus Type Vertical Axis Wind Blade for Low Wind Speed,"Mortel, Christian M.;Serano, Nicanor L.;Decena, John Gabriel","Straight-bladed Darrieus blade is a type of vertical axis wind turbine that requires low wind speed to operate but is considered less efficient due to conventional blade geometry. To increase its performance by means of dynamic torque, the study used a statistical method, central composite design, through DesignExpert software. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) through SolidWorks Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes Equation (RANS) k ‚Äì epsilon turbulence model was used to simulate the Design of Experiments. The study was composed of two phases, namely 2D and 3D simulations. The 2D simulation studied the effect of varying the camber, camber location, and thickness to the dynamic torque, while the 3D simulation varied the blade height, rotor radius, and materials. The camber‚Äôs optimal conditions, camber location, and thickness in 2D simulations are 4.75%, 45%, and 15.50% of the chord, respectively. These optimal design values could reach the dynamic torque equivalent to 60.6571 Newton-meter. Meanwhile, the blade height and rotor radius of the 3D simulations have optimal design values of 4.41 meters and 4.75 meters, respectively. These optimal values could increase the dynamic torque to 2310.01 Newton-meter. The dynamic torque of the optimal design obtained a 133% significant increase compared to the conventional blade.

A methanolic extract of Ecklonia cava exhibited strong antibacterial activity against S. parauberis isolated from olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. Furthermore, the n-hexane soluble (Hexane) fraction of the E. cava methanolic extract exhibited the greatest antibacterial effect on S. parauberis strains with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranging from 256 to 1,024Œºg/mL. In addition, the MIC values of oxytetracycline against antibiotic-resistant S. parauberis were markedly reduced up to 64-fold in combination with the Hexane fraction, suggesting that the antibacterial activity of the antibiotic was restored when combined with the Hexane fraction. The interaction between both antibiotics and the Hexane fraction was assessed by the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index. The Hexane fraction and oxytetracycline combination against antibiotic-resistant S. parauberis strains resulted in a median ${\sum}FIC$ range of 0.502 to 0.516.

Avicennia genetic diversity and fine-scaled structure influenced by coastal proximity of mangrove fragments,"Triest, Ludwig;Socorro, Alieza Del;Gado, Vincent Jay;Mazo, Analyn M.;Sierens, Tim","Avicennia dominated mangrove forests occur from seaward to landward sites and hence are subject to different dynamics within estuarine ecosystems. Regeneration of mangrove forests primarily depends on the extent of propagule spread and subsequent establishment in suitable habitats. The complex nature of estuarine systems induces a wide variety of local conditions for within-site propagule retention and settlement thereby allowing spontaneous regeneration of mangroves. In this study, we estimated the fine-scale spatial genetic structure (FSGS) of Avicennia populations and examined whether their position relative to the seaside or the size of mangrove patches could have influenced the extant local population genetic structure. A kinship-based FSGS was performed using microsatellite markers in 523 A. marina, 189 A. rumphiana and 60 A. alba adult trees of 24 sites in The Philippines. Transects within each estuary were taken both parallel and perpendicular to the coastline or tidal river edge. The extent of local mangrove areas and various human-induced encroachments as such did not show any trend in allele diversity, heterozygosity values or inbreeding levels. However, farther inland situated mangrove patches showed a larger FSGS extent across the neighborhood (up to 75 m) though less diversity along with inbreeding, most likely due to retention of related propagules and lowered chance of external propagule input. Estimation of connectivity along a same coastline stretch supported a unidirectional steppingstone or adjacent migration model for populations of either A. marina, A. alba or A. rumphiana. These were congruent with ocean currents across mangrove estuaries of the Tablas Strait and along Western Leyte, thereby emphasizing the relevance of coastal connectivity for long term persistence. From this study, we conclude that both proximity to open water and narrowness of mangrove patches may affect their captured diversity, inbreeding and fine-scale structure caused by propagule movement within or beyond a local mangrove fragment during recent generations. Higher levels of allele diversity for seaward sites and highest likelihood of migration for adjacent mangroves both add to the importance of coastal connectivity that is the only natural cohesive force on longer term and necessary to counteract short term effects of increasingly encroached mangrove environments.",RSU,San Andres

Using the maximum entropy (Maxent) algorithm, we developed a species distribution model (SDM) for C. calauanica based on 19 bioclimatic variables, using occurrence data obtained mostly from field surveys conducted in A. rigidus-infested areas in Luzon Island from 2014 to 2016. The calculated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values for the model were very high (0.966, standard deviation = 0.005), indicating the model‚Äôs high predictive power. Precipitation seasonality was found to have the highest relative contribution to model development. Response curves produced by Maxent suggested the positive influence of mean temperature of the driest quarter, and negative influence of precipitation of the driest and coldest quarters on habitat suitability. Given that C. calauanica has been found to always occur with A. rigidus in Luzon Island due to high host-specificity, the SDM for the parasitoid may also be considered and used as a predictive model for its host. This was confirmed through field surveys conducted between late 2016 and early 2018, which found and confirmed the occurrence of A. rigidus in three areas predicted by the SDM to have moderate to high habitat suitability or probability of occurrence of C. calauanica: Zamboanga City in Mindanao; Isabela City in Basilan Island; and Tablas Island in Romblon. This validation in the field demonstrated the utility of the bioclimate-based SDM for C. calauanica in predicting habitat suitability or probability of occurrence of A. rigidus in the Philippines",RSU,Main
Interactive Growcut Multi-Label N-D Segmentation Based Algorithm for SCLERA Segmentation,"Hellwig, Laarni R.;Cayabyab, Gerald;Aragon, Ma. Cristina;Medina, Ruji P.;","This paper presents a computationally efficient sclera detection, segmentation and enhancement approach. The proposed sclera detection and segmentation approach is developed based on the cellular automaton which evolves using the Grow-Cut algorithm and enhancement approach based on Multiscale Retinex. The major advantage of the developed approach is its computational simplicity, speed and accuracy as compared to the prior detection, segmentation and enhancement approaches developed for sclera segmentation images. The new used approach was tested in Intel i5 4570 with 3.2 GHZ processor and 16GB RAM and Intel Dual Core with 2.48GHZ processor and with 2GB RAM. Using these two different units, the result shows that segmentation under Intel i5 segment sclera for three 3 hours with an image size of 640x480 pixels while in Intel Dual Core 2GB RAM having the same image size segments the sclera for fourteen (14) hours and eighteen (18) minutes. The experimental results obtained from ND-IRIS 0405 database and publicly available images and respectively achieved better performance in terms of computational simplicity, speed and accuracy as compared to the previous proposed method. Multiscale Retinex enhanced image very fast with a highest minimum execution time of seventeen seconds (17secs) for an image size of 640 x 480 pixels for both colour and gray scale. The proposed approach for enhancement shows better performance in enhancing low contrast, dark with poor illumination images but colour rendition is quite poor for images having good illumination. The experimental results presented in this paper clearly demonstrate the applicability of the proposed sclera detection, segmentation and enhancement approach, i.e., significant reduction in computational complexity in detection segmentation and enhancement while providing comparable segmentation and enhancement performance.",RSU,San Fernando

The result shows that GSTC performs well as a feature compared to FBEs, but FBEs tend to perform better when combined with other feature. This shows that a combination of features set is promising in obtaining a higher accuracy compared to a single feature in environmental sound classification, that is helpful in the development of the machine hearing systems.",RSU,Main
"Drying Kinetics and Anticoagulant Activity of Microwave-Vacuum, Dehumidified-Air and Freeze-dried African Night Crawler (Eudrilus eugenia Kinberg)","Fortu Jr., Alfredo F.;Lozada, Ep;Suministrado, Ek;Yaptenco, Kevin","In this study, the drying kinetics and anticoagulant activity of dried earthworm Eudrilus eugeniae were compared using microwave-vacuum, dehumidified-air, and freeze-drying. Data showed that microwave-vacuum and dehumidified-air drying methods have relatively short drying time, higher drying rate, and have low operational cost compared with freeze-drying. The Two-term, Midilli, and Diffusion models fit the best in describing drying kinetics under microwave-vacuum, dehumidified-air, and freeze-drying, respectively. The water activity of the dried sample was in the acceptable value for safe storage through the dehumidified-air dried sample was in the critical range. Proximate analysis showed that dried earthworms have high protein content ranging from 60 to 70 percent of its total dry weight. The anticoagulant assay showed that fresh earthworm is potent as heparin showing no coagulation. Microwave-vacuum dried earthworm exhibited the strongest anticoagulant activity compared with other drying methods though weaker than the fresh sample. This study suggests that earthworms have anticoagulant activity, and microwave-vacuum and dehumidified-air drying could be an alternative method for drying the heat-sensitive sample.",RSU,Main
Current Status of sea grapes (Caulerpa spp.) farming and wild harvesting in the Philippines,"Estrada, Jeremaiah L.;Arboleda, Mark Dondi M.;Dionisio-Sese, Maribel L.","This paper describes for the first time the community perception and awareness of sea grapes (Caulerpa spp.) and sea grape farming, its lean and peak seasons, harvest volume and production, prices in market outlets as well as factors affecting the distribution in selected regions in the Philippines through a multi-region socio-economic survey. The majority of the respondents were aware of the presence of sea grapes in their areas since the 1980s but uninformed of their potential to be cultivated. The dry season (January‚ÄìApril) was perceived to be the peak season of sea grapes, both in culture and wild, in the different areas studied with Mactan, Cebu as the top producer, generating an estimated 42,222 kg per month. In market outlets, Calapan and Puerto Galera exhibited the highest market price for sea grapes (PhP 155‚Äì160 kg‚àí1) (USD 3.23‚Äì3.33 kg‚àí1) in the last 4 years. Socio-economic factors like gender, civil status, education, and income also affected the harvest distribution. The estimated annual income generated via farming and wild harvesting is valued at around PhP 2,259,456 (USD 47,702) during peak season. This study highlights how sea grapes are regarded as an economically important commodity in the Philippines and should be conserved to ensure availability and sustainable production. Furthermore, this research could serve as a basis for policymakers and scientists in addressing challenges and gaps in Caulerpa industry.",RSU,Main
Consensus-Based Education: Its Effect on College Students' Achievement in Bioenergetics as Moderated by Gender and Learning Styles,"Fetalvero, Eddie G.","Involving students in making an educational decision is claimed to produce better outcomes. The effect of consensus-based education (CBE) on achievement in bioenergetics as moderated by gender and learning styles was determined. Two undergraduate biology classes were compared employing the quasi-experimental design, one using CBE and the other taught the conventional way. The Biology Achievement Test (BAT) was the main data collection tool used, supplemented with questionnaires, learning style inventory, videos, journal, and informal interviews. ANCOVA tested the effect of educational approach and the moderating effects of gender and learning styles while t-test compared the BAT scores between the groups. Results show that CBE can be a feasible alternative approach to teaching biology as it fairly addresses issues on gender and learning styles. It has also helped students develop their reasoning skills and improve their appreciation of democratic practices in the classroom.",RSU,Main
Thinking and Innovation of Teenagers' Sci & Tech Education Approaches Based on Innovative Thinking Training,"Ren, Yong Li;Ruga, Reynaldo V.","Adolescence is an important crossroad that determines students' future development and personal choice. Many people benefit from their chances in adolescence for life, but more people miss the opportunity. Improving young people's scientific literacy is an important guarantee to improve national innovation ability. Knowledge innovation provides new theories and methods for human beings to understand and transform the world, and it is the inexhaustible motive force for human civilization progress and social development. Innovative thinking refers to the thinking process of solving problems with novel and original methods, which is one of the important symbols of scientific literacy. Based on the current situation of Sci & Tech education, this paper discusses the methods of youth Sci & Tech education, and puts forward some suggestions on youth Sci & Tech education from the perspective of cultivating innovative thinking. In the cultivation of young people's innovative thinking in Sci & Tech, we should grasp the connection among universities, middle schools and primary schools, and at the same time, we must construct innovative thinking cultivation methods and put forward specific plans in the process of thinking cultivation.",RSU,San Fernando

Analyzing Students' Achievement and Attitude through the Frankards Context in Learning Probability,"Fran, Frankie A.","In learning abstract mathematical concepts such as probability, students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills are enhanced. However, learning this concept through abstraction would be a great challenge to students who are struggling in mathematics. Hence, an instructional support would be a great help. This study analysed the effect of using Frankards, an instructional material manipulative in teaching probability, on students' achievement and attitude. Specifically, it aimed to determine the students' level of achievement, students' level of attitude, towards mathematics and the relationship between achievement and attitude. Quasi-Experimental Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design and purposive sampling were used where respondents were grouped into two: experimental group (taught with Frankards) and control group (taught without Frankards). A multiple choice pretest and posttest were administered to both groups to determine the difference between students' achievement. Guce and Talen's Scale on Attitude Towards Mathematics (SATM) and a multiple-choice achievement test were utilized as research instruments. The results showed that there was a significant difference between the experimental and control group in terms of achievement where students taught with Frankards outperformed the control group. It was also found that there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in terms of attitude. Moreover, the relationship between achievement and attitude (in terms of student engagement and liking mathematics) was found. The utilization of Frankards is recommended in teaching probability.",RSU,Main
ACC deaminase and indole acetic acid producing endophytic bacterial co-inoculation improves physiological traits of red pepper (Capsicum annum L.) under salt stress,"Choudhury, Ar;Choi, Jeongyun;Walitang, Denver;Truvedi, Pankaj;Lee, Yi;Sa, Tongmin","Salinity induces myriad of physiological and biochemical perturbations in plants and its amelioration can be attained by the use of potential bacterial synthetic communities. The use of microbial consortia in contrast to single bacterial inoculation can additively enhance stress tolerance and productivity of agricultural crops. In this study, co-inoculation of Pseudomonas koreensis S2CB45 and Microbacterium hydrothermale IC37-36 isolated from arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) spore and rice seed endosphere, respectively, were used to evaluate the physiological and biochemical effects on red pepper at two salt concentrations (75 mM and 150 mM). Plant growth promoting characteristics particularly 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity, indole acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinin production were higher during co-culturing compared to the individual bacterial culture. The higher ACC deaminase activity had resulted in 20% and 22% decrease in stress ethylene emission compared to the non-inoculated plants at 75 mM and 150 mM salt stress, respectively. The decline in ethylene emission had eventually reduced ROS accumulation, and the co-inoculated plants had also harbored enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities and higher sugar accumulation compared to the other treatments suggesting enhanced tolerance to salinity. Collectively, these results put forward a novel consortium of bacterial strains that can be used for sustainable agricultural practices against salinity.",RSU,Main
Phlogiellus bundokalbo Spider Venom: Cytotoxic Fractions against Human Lung Adenocarninoma (A549) Cells,"Mayor, Anna Beatriz R.;Guevarra, Jr. Leonardo;Santiago, Myla;Santiago, Librado;","Spider venom is a potential source of pharmacologically important compounds. Previous studies on spider venoms reported the presence of bioactive molecules that possess cell-modulating activities. Despite these claims, sparse scientific evidence is available on the cytotoxic mechanisms in relation to the components of the spider venom. In this study, we aimed to determine the cytotoxic fractions of the spider venom extracted from Phlogiellus bundokalbo and to ascertain the possible mechanism of toxicity towards human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. Methods: Spider venom was extracted by electrostimulation. Components of the extracted venom were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a linear gradient of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and 0.1% TFA in 95% acetonitrile (ACN). Cytotoxic activity was evaluated by the MTT assay. Apoptotic or necrotic cell death was assessed by microscopic evaluation in the presence of Hoechst 33342 and Annexin V, Alexa FluorTM 488 conjugate fluorescent stains, and caspase activation assay. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity of the cytotoxic fractions were also measured. Results: We observed and isolated six fractions from the venom of P. bundokalbo collected from Aurora, Zamboanga del Sur. Four of these fractions displayed cytotoxic activities. Fractions AT5-1, AT5-3, and AT5-4 were found to be apoptotic while AT5-6, the least polar among the cytotoxic components, was observed to induce necrosis. PLA2 activity also showed cytotoxicity in all fractions but presented no relationship between specific activity of PLA2 and cytotoxicity. Conclusion: The venom of P. bundokalbo spider, an endemic tarantula species in the Philippines, contains components that were able to induce either apoptosis or necrosis in A549 cells.",RSU,Main
Methanogenesis and Methane Oxidation in Paddy Fields under Organic Fertilization,"Walitang, Denver I.;Kim, Chungwoo;Sa, Tongmin","Global warming is one of the mostpressing environmental issues which concomitantly com-plicates global climate change. Methane emission is a bal-ance between methanogenesis and methane consumption,both of which are driven by microbial actions in differentecosystems producing methane, one of the major green-house gases. Paddy fields are major sources of anthro-pogenic methane emissions and could be compounded byorganic fertilization. Literature reviews wereconducted to give an overview of the global warming con-ditions and to present the relationship of carbon and meth-ane to greenhouse gas emissions, and the need to under-stand the underlying processes of methane emission. Amore extensive review was done from studies on methaneemission in paddy fields under organic fertilization withgreater emphasis on long term amendments. Changes inpaddy soils due to organic fertilization include alterationsof the physicochemical properties and changes in biologi-cal components. There are diverse phylogenetic groups of methanogens and methane oxidizing bacteria involved inmethane emission. Also, multiple factors influence meth-anogenesis and methane oxidation in rice paddy fields un-der organic fertilization and they should be greatly con-sidered when developing mitigating steps in methaneemission in paddy fields especially under long term or-ganic fertilization. his review showed that organic fer-tilization, particularly for long term management practi-ces, influenced both physicochemical and biologicalcomponents of the paddy fields which could ultimatelyaffect methanogenesis, methane oxidation, and methaneemission. Understanding interrelated factors affectingmethane emission helps create ways to mitigate their im-pact on global warming and climate change.",RSU,Main

It examined the role of their sex, grade level, and academic track on their macro skills and communication apprehension. The data were gathered using a self-administered questionnaire, which measured the respondents‚Äô level of macro skills and communication apprehension. A total of randomly selected 525 senior high school students participated in this study. Data were analysed using descriptive and non- parametric inferential statistics to reveal relationships and variations among the variables. This study disclosed that the respondents‚Äô macro skills level ranges from satisfactory to very satisfactory and that their communication apprehension level is only average. CA level of the students does not influence their macro skills level. Among the macro skill dimensions, female senior high school students possess better ability in reading than their male counterparts while they share similarities in their listening, speaking, and writing skills. Those from the grade 12 show better macro skills than those from grade 11 students except in writing skill wherein they show the same skill level. Students from the academic track are far better when it comes to reading and writing, while the students from the TVL track exhibits better skills concerning listening and speaking.

Conservation and Transmission of Seed Bacterial endophytes across generations following Crossbreeding and Repeated Inbreeding of Rice at Different Geographic Locations,"Walitang, Denver I.;Kim, Chan-Gi;Jeon, Sunyoung;Kang, Yeongyeong;Sa, Tongmin;","There are comparatively diverse bacterial communities inside seeds, which are vertically transmitted and conserved, becoming sources of endophytes in the next generation of host plants. We studied how rice seed endophyte composition changed over time following crossbreeding, repeated inbreeding, subsequent human selection and planting of different rice seeds in different ecogeographical locations. Using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to study bacterial communities, we observed that diversity between the original parents and their offspring may show significant differences in richness, evenness and diversity indices. Heat maps reveal substantial contributions of both or either parent in the shaping of the bacterial seed endophytes of the offspring. Most of the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) of the subsequent progeny could be traced to any or both of its parents while unique T-RFs of the offspring suggest external sources of colonization particularly when the seeds were cultivated in different locations. Many similar groups of endophytic bacteria persist in the seeds even after recultivation in different locations, indicating resilience to environmental changes and conservation of bacteria across generations. This study suggests that parent plants contributed to the shaping of seed bacterial endophytes of their offspring, although it is also possible that these soil grown rice plants recruit similar populations of endophytes from the soil generation after generation. This study also highlights some bacterial groups belonging to Herbaspirillum, Microbacterium, Curtobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Xanthomonas and Enterobacter that may be part of a transmitted and conserved ‚Äúcore microbiota‚Äù that are ubiquitous and dominant members of the endophytic communities of the rice seeds.",RSU,Main
Determination of Flower Bud Initiation in Oriental Hybrid Lilies 'Siberia' and 'Sorborne',"Lucidos, Juniel Galido;Younis, Adnan;Lim, Ki-Byung;","The flower initiation stage is one of the most critical stages in plant development. This study was conducted with an aim of identifying the precise flower bud initiation stage in oriental lily hybrids, ‚ÄòSorbonne‚Äô and ‚ÄòSiberia‚Äô, for the purpose of proper plant management during the flower development stage. The bulbs were micro-dissected 0, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days after planting. Five bulbs were randomly selected for dissection and flower bud initiation stage identification. Bulb circumference, shoot length, number of bulb scales, number of leafy scales, number of true/alternate leaves, and flower bud initiation stage were measured. The flower bud initiation stages were scaled as follows: 0 = no flower buds, 1 = starting stage, 2 = flower bud developing stage, and 3 = fully developed flower bud stage. In both the hybrids, flower bud initiation started 20 days after planting and was observed to be associated with shoot length; the initiation occurring in shoots 11‚Äì13cm long. It was also greatly affected by the cultural management during the growing of plants. Identification of the exact time of flower bud initiation will be useful in proper management of the plant materials with respect to their requirements of water, nutrient, environmental conditions, and pest control. This knowledge will help in developing quality flowers of the two studied oriental lily hybrids for breeding and commercial purposes.",RSU,Main

ACC deaminase-producing Brevibacterium linensRS16 enhances heat-stress tolerance of rice (Oryza sativa L.),"Walitang, Denver I.;Choi, Jeongyun;Choudhury, Ar;Lee, Yi;Sa, Tongmin;","The rapid rise in global temperature has adverse effects on rice productivity. The lack of eminent resources for heat stress alleviation is threatening the agricultural sector. Heat stress alleviation by endophytic plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) can be a sustainable and eco-friendly approach. The present study was conducted to check the colonization of Brevibacterium linens RS16 producing ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate) deaminase in the rice endosphere and to characterize its efficiency in enhancing stress tolerance. The ethylene emission pathway, reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations, proline accumulation, expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST), and small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) were monitored at two different levels of heat stress (40¬∞C and 45¬∞C). Bacterial inoculation decreased ethylene emission levels by 26.9% and 24.4% in rice plants exposed to 40¬∞C and 45¬∞C, respectively, compared with the non-inoculated plants. B. linens RS16 also enhanced the expression profiles of glutathione S-transferase. The collective effect of GST expression profiles and decrease in ethylene emission due to bacterial ACC deaminase activity subsequently resulted in a decrease in ROS concentrations. Additionally, HSP16 and HSP26 increased expression in heat-stressed plants inoculated with B. linens RS16 resulted in enhanced stress tolerance (i.e., lesser proline accumulation) than non-inoculated plants. Hence, this study demonstrates the bacteria-mediated tolerance against heat stress by regulating the ethylene emission pathway and upregulating antioxidant enzymes and heat shock proteins.",RSU,Main

Characteristirizing the Government's Preventive Measure in Combating COVID-19 Pandemic in the Philippines: A Content Analysis,"Fontamillas, Kriesler I.","By and large, COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented circumstance that impacted millions of people around the globe. This is a new strain of coronavirus that targets one‚Äôs lower respiratory tract and most likely to infect those who are immunosuppressed. Thus, this qualitative paper answers the question, What characterizes the preventive measures of the government to combat COVID-19 in the Philippines? The research design employed was content analysis with news articles in three major dailies in the country as its corpora of data. From the cool and warm analyses of the field text, four measures emerged, labeled as ‚Äòpreventive nodes‚Äô namely: communication node which refers to government‚Äôs way of disseminating the needed information and coming up with an alternative in saving the lives of many while vaccines are still on progress; accommodation node which pertains to supplementary efforts from the government in addressing health, social and economic concerns brought by COVID-19; assessment node which relates to the issues that have to be improved both of government and its people; and impact node which refers to government‚Äôs way of reporting the cases that may indicate the result of their measure. It was concluded that these nodes may promote a sense of awareness and provide knowledge to the public, alleviate financial constraints, hunger, and unemployment, come up with a better response and arrive at informed decisions in taking actions to impede this crisis.",RSU,Main
Use of Bioinoculants in the Modulation of Volatile Organic Compounds Emission Under Environmental Stresses for Sustainable Agriculture,"Walitang, Denver I.;Chatterjee, Poulami;Samaddar, Sandipan;Choudhury, Aritra Roy;Jeon, Sunyoung;Sa, Tongmin;","Long-term effects of chemical applications in agroecosystems have brought about the rise in awareness with greater emphasis on sustainable development and eco-friendly agriculture. This has opened up the advancement and increased utilization of biofertilizers as key components acting as nutrient suppliers and lower agricultural burden that lead to sustainable agriculture and conservation of the environment. Predominant biofertilizers are plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) with plant growth-promoting functional traits. Bacteria containing ACC deaminase are well-known to provide plant stress tolerance by reducing the ethylene level in stress-elicited plant; on the other hand, the physiological responses and mechanism of improved plant stress resistance by bacteria are poorly understood. As a part of plant defence against biotic and abiotic stresses, plants release a range of volatile organic compounds (VOC). Though VOC emission is a part of plant defence, it has a large impact to the environment and climate change. The higher atmospheric reactivity of VOC leads to generation of ozone, secondary aerosol formation and cloud formation. However, the emission of VOCs from different plant species is well studied in this respect, but the control of VOC emission from plants is a complex and open question. This chapter aims to focus on the function of the ACC deaminase-containing bacteria in controlling VOC emission along with other plant growth-promoting characteristics.",RSU,Main
Diversity and Plant Growth-Promoting Potential of Bacterial Endophytes in Rice,"Walitang, Denver I.","Rice seed is colonized by endophytic bacterial communities which becomes a source of endophytes and allows for a diverse bacterial community to occur inside the plant host. These endophytes can provide beneficial effects to growth and development of the host plant. Furthermore, the diversity of endophytic bacteria is dynamic within the host plant. Variations as well as density of populations of endophytic bacteria usually decline from the root to the leaf region of the plants. This review gives an overview of the plant growth-promoting mechanisms of endophytes with respect to their intensely studied plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) counterparts. The community dynamics and diversity of bacterial endophytes associated with rice and its microniches including roots, shoots, and the seeds were also discussed. This review also delves into the proposed concept of a potential core microbiota of rice, bacterial endophytes that are highly associated with rice, as well as the interesting abilities of seed endophytes to be transmitted and conserved through generations of rice hosts via the seeds.",RSU,Main

Smartphone-based optical transduction for the rapid microscale assessment of iodate in table salt,"Galiga, Henley F.;Sevilla, Fortunato B.","The measurement of iodine in table salt is vital for the successful implementation of the universal salt iodization (USI) program to fight iodine deficiency disorders (IDDs). This paper presents a smartphone-based optical transduction system for iodine measurement in table salt. The method was based on the response in the blue color space generated by the complex formed between the starch/iodide reagent and iodate in the salt sample. The parameters for the color reaction and for the image capture affected the response and were optimized. A matrix effect caused by NaCl was observed and was eliminated through matrix matching by incorporating NaCl in the standard solutions. The optimized method yielded a highly linear response to iodate concentrations ranging from 10 to 160 mg kg‚àí1 (r = 0.9993) with a limit of detection of 2.8 mg kg‚àí1. The method exhibited good accuracy and precision, based on AOAC standards. It produced results that were in agreement with those obtained using the reference method at the 95% confidence level. The smartphone performs optical transduction, as well as signal processing, to yield a display of the iodate concentration in the salt sample. The use of smartphones presents a simple, inexpensive, portable, and widely available device for on-site analysis of iodate in table salt.",RSU,Main

Development of an Improvised Convertible Distillation Apparatus for Teaching and Learning Chemistry,"Galiga, Henley F.","Distillation is an important concept in chemistry as it involves
 separation techniques which are widely used in various industries. However,despite its significance, it is hardly understood and appreciated because it is rarely performed in laboratory experiments. Distillation requires expensive apparatus to conduct which most schools cannot afford. Hence, an improvised convertible distillation apparatus for simple, fractional and steam distillation was developed using common household and recyclable materials. Improvised measuring devices were also fabricated to determine the purity of the distillates. The performance of improvised apparatus was assessed and compared with the standard apparatus using real samples. The
 improvised apparatus, using fractional distillation set-up, produced 91.3% alcohol from alcoholic beverage while the simple/steam distillation setup,yielded distilled water from the salt-water sample and essential oil from pomelo (Citrus maxima) peel with percentage yield of 0.56%, respectively.The improvised apparatus for fractional distillation yielded a higher alcohol content (xÃÖ=91.3%; 95%CI=91.0, 91.6) than the standard apparatus (xÃÖ=85.7%; 95%CI=85.3, 86.1) while the efficiency of separation of the improvised apparatus for simple/steam distillation was comparable with standard apparatus. Thus, the improvised apparatus offers a cheaper alternative for conducting distillation process in chemistry experiments. The cost of performing distillation process is further reduced by using improvised measuring devices to measure the purity of the distillates in lieu of chemicals and reagents. Aside from being cost-effective, the improvised apparatus is easy to construct, durable, user-friendly and safe to use.",RSU,Main

From these specimens, the minimum and maximum total lengths were 11.50 cm to 22 cm while its body weights ranged from 13 g to 100 g, respectively. D. macrosoma was capable of spawning whole year round. Two spawning peaks were observed (February and August to September) based on the monthly mean gonadosomatic indices. Male appeared to dominate female as evidenced by its sex ratios. The lengths at 50% maturity of female and male D. macrosoma were estimated at 15.29 cm and 17.22 cm, respectively. D. macrosoma was caught in volume through commercial ring net at a depth of about 150 m-200 m within the municipal waters. Coastal waters near barangay Canjalon and Agtiwa were identified as the main fishing grounds of D. macrosoma in San Fernando, Romblon. This initial data on spawning period may be used as a basis in implementing closed fishing season of D. macrosoma in the locality, and the length of maturity may as well be used for the allowable size of the capture of this species.",RSU,San Fernando
"Sea Grapes (Caulerpa spp.) (Chlorophyta: Caulerpaceae) from Coron, Northern Palawan, Philippines with Notes on their Harvest and Production","Estrada, Jeremiah L.;Sese, Maribel D.","Caulerpa species, collectively known as ""sea grapes"", are widely cultivated and harvested in the Philippines. This study identified Caulerpa species from Coron, Northern Palawan based upon their morphology, and described for the first time the current status of Caulerpa harvesting in the municipality through a social survey. A total of two species (Caulerpa lentillifera and Caulerpa racemosa) with two varieties of the latter species (C. racemosa var. turbinata and C. racemosa var. laetevirens) were identified and distinguished by their ramuli characteristics. Data from a select group of fisherfolks, market vendors, and buyers showed that wild harvesting of sea grapes has been practiced since the 1990s, signifying that the seaweeds have been regarded as a source of food and income in the last three decades. The dry season (January to April) is perceived as the peak season for sea grape harvesting and their prices have remained constant at PhP 40.00/kg (USD 0.79/kg) over the past four years. The estimated annual income during the peak season is valued at around PhP 48,480.00 (USD 918.53). In Coron, it is suggested that the supply is adequate for their local market demand given the current harvesting methods. The possibilities of phycoculture of sea grapes have also been explored but, at present, with only limited success. This study revealed that Caulerpa is still regarded as an economically important crop that provides income and livelihood to the Calamian archipelago and has the potential to be cultivated for sustainable production and use.",RSU,Main

Various techniques have been adopted to address the scarcity of agricultural lands or even backyards for planting, yet costs and value of such techniques may have been too high. One method that could be used in short time-span agriculture is planting in biodegradable stems. Due to the abundance of water in the banana stems and its capacity to retain, it has a good potential as an alternative for planting media in limited agricultural lands. This study aimed at determining whether the banana pseudo-stem can retain water until pechay harvest. A split plot experimental design invented by Fisher (1935) was used in this investigation. In comprises two (2) different treatments under the experimental group and one (1) control as basis for comparison. The researchers also measured the leas blade length, height, number of leaves to measure the growth rate of the plants under different treatment factors. The study revealed that there was an increase in terms of the numbers of leaves, height, and leaf blade length in the pechay when planted on banana pseudo-stems than those which were planted in a ploy bag. Although results showed that there were no significant differences between treatments, Treatment A (watered everyday) got a higher result using the parameters compared to the rest of the treatments. This study also revealed that Treatment B with pechay planted in banana pseudo-stem watered thrice a week, and the Control group with pechay planted in poly bags watered everyday, yielded almost the same results. Thus, banana pseudo-stem have the capacity to retain water for pechay growth and production.

"Enhancing the Role of Women on Food Security and Nutrition Through Homestead Farm System in Selected Rural Areas In the Highland Regions of the Philippines
 
 Project Components:
 1. Determination of the changing pattern of food selection and its impact on the extent of ""hidden hunger in selected rural areas in the highland regions
 2. An analysis of the ""orphaned food"" in rural households: Its implication on food security and changing household expenditures on food
 3. Examining labor supply decisions of women in the rural highlands","Navarro, Gladys M.","This paper views hidden hunger as an outcome of structural changes in the subsistence agricultural sector. The
 entry of market and cash economy changed the food basket of highland households, which as a consequence
 unconsciously encouraged the loss of the homestead farm system, which forms the major food ecology of the
 farming households. Women had in the process of changes became income producers of the farm enterprise and
 had veered away from their role as food and plant nurturers. Along the process, indigenous plants as source of nutrffion had been substituted by instant food. The paper views behavioral changes in the pattern of food choices
 and consumption in the light of changing land use of farm plots, and labor supply decisions of the households,
 women in particular. The paper aims to answer the question? ""Is hidden hunger worth the value of the loss of the
 homestead farm system?"" To address this question, the proposal is composed of three projects. Project 1
 evaluates the changing patterns of food selection and preparation, while estimating also the loss in nutrient intake
 due to substitution effects; Project 2 Identifies and analyzes orphaned crops which used to be propagated in the
 backyard but had long been abandoned due to commercial farming; and Project 3 synthesizes the projects
 through an analysis of labor supply decisions of women as contextualized outcomes of hidden hunger. The
 expectation from the labor supply model will indicate the following: Assuming that women work both in farm and
 for their homestead farms the following relationship must hold true: (1) A direct relationship is expected between
 hidden hunger and labor supply for farm work; and (2) an inverse relationship is expected between hidden
 hunger and labor supply for homestead farm systems.",SLU,Main

 Department of Health (DOH) and others. The following are the brief descriptions of the method of production of the PPEs:
 Face Mask
 This is a washable face mask made from a cotton, water absorbent and water repellent cloth for adult and children. It is made of a three
 layer of cloth to make sure that droplet and the virus cannot penetrate to the mouth. The dimension will be 4‚Äù x 6 1‚ÅÑ2‚Äù for adult and 3‚Äù x 5‚Äù for
 children. In the production of face mask, fabric is collected and checked in accordance with to specification, quality, widths, dye lot and
 markings. Fabric is soak /dip dried and pressed in accordance with standard fabric care. After which, measuring tools and equipment are
 prepared and checked.
 
 Then, the next step is the lay-outing and marking of the pattern on materials/fabric. This will be followed by the cutting of fabric/cloth and
 sewing. Sewed face mask will be checked to ensure the quality of the product.
 Face Shield
 The materials need for face shield production are clear plastic sheet for the visor, styro foam as stopper for the visor and for the user to
 breath.
 Garter to bind the visor in place. The process of making the face shield includes: (1) Cutting the styro foam with approximate 9‚Äù long and 1‚Äù
 width; (2) Using the plastic clear sheet, punch one hole both side; (3) Apply double sided tape unto the styro foam, bond the styro foam to the
 edge of the clear plastic sheet. Pressure should be applied in order to bind the area and to fix it well; (4) Attach the garter to the hole in both
 sides of the plastic sheet. Then round the bottom using scissors.
 Liquid Hand Soap
 The liquid hand soap will be prepared by using water, bar soap, glycerin and essential oil as the main ingredients. The bar soap will be
 shredded and will be put into heat with water until melted. Glycerin will be added afterwards. The melted soap will be removed from the heat
 and will be covered. It will be set for 12-24 hours. After the soap thickens overnight, the soap will be blended. Adjustment will be made by
 repeating previous step as necessary and the solution will be transferred to containers for storage.
 Coordination and Distribution Mechanisms:
 The coordination and distribution will be done across all campuses. Each campus will facilitate the segregation and distribution of the PPEs
 to their employees and their families inside the campus according to schedules.
 For the distribution to students and their families, this will be done through the established SLSU-LGU Links/Kiosks. The students residing in
 a certain municipality will go the link/kiosk in their municipality to get the PPEs for their families according to schedules to observe the
 protocols of the IATF. This must be properly coordinated with the Local Government Units for the support and further protection protocols.
 The actual distribution will be managed by the link/kiosk in-charge in each municipality.",SoLSU,Main
Production of Medically Acceptable Face Shield for Covid-19 Virus Transmission and Contagion,"Labrador, Mirador G.","The existing Fabrication Laboratory of the University undertakes the production of the utilization of 3D printers. Considering the urgent necessity and high demand for the use of face shields, the designers take into consideration reducing the manufacturing time without compromising the quality. Also, the team considers the comfortability of the design faceshield as used by the end-user and the compatibility of the defined standards set by WHO. Furthermore, materials are scientifically selected based on their function and use i.e. PVC plastic was selected as a plastic shield since it is chemically made of lead, chloride, and the usual plastic components. Note, that is a known fact, that chloride solutions kill viruses and also lead to repressed viral activity. Hence the use of PVC based on the literature is more effective when used as a faceshield to combat COVID-19.

"eHMCOKE: an enhanced overlapping clustering algorithm for 
 data analysis","Danganan, Alvincent E.;De Los Reyes, Edjie M.","Improved multi-cluster overlapping k-means extension (IMCOKE) uses 
 median absolute deviation (MAD) in detecting outliers in datasets makes the 
 algorithm more effective with regards to overlapping clustering. Nevertheless, 
 analysis of the applied MAD positioning was not considered. In this paper, the 
 incorporation of MAD used to detect outliers in the datasets was analyzed to 
 determine the appropriate position in identifying the outlier before applying it 
 in the clustering application. And the assumption of the study was the size of 
 the cluster and cluster that are close to each other can led to a higher runtime 
 performance in terms of overlapping clusters. Therefore, additional 
 parameters such as radius of clusters and distance between clusters are added 
 measurements in the algorithm procedures. Evaluation was done through 
 experimentations using synthetic and real datasets. The performance of the 
 eHMCOKE was evaluated via F1-measure criterion, speed and percentage of 
 improvement. Evaluation results revealed that the eHMCOKE takes less time 
 to discover overlap clusters with an improvement rate of 22% and achieved

Manufacture of Non-Medicine Products by UEP,"Cui-Lim, Karina Milagros R.","The people of Northern Samar, with a population of approximately 700,000 people live in and subsists on the different Island towns surrounded by species of palms, like Nypa fruticans Wurmb (Nipa). Until this day, Nipa is an underutilized plant resource since the only use of the nipa leaves is for roofing. The fruit of nipa is still of no economic use to the people of Northern Samar. Nypa fruticans, commonly known as the nipa palm, is a species of palm native to the coastlines and estuarine habitats on the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is the only palm considered adapted to the mangrove biome. This species is the only member of the genus Nypa and the subfamily Nypoideae, forming monotypic taxa.
 After maturing the fruits are usually pushed off from the infructescence by the developing plumule. They float in tidal water and start growing on a suitable substrate. The radicle is probably aborted and the first root that appears is likely to be the first adventitious root. The seedling is prostate first, but after being attached to the substrate, the plumules become erect and additional adventitious arise from the lower part of the stem. In very young seedlings the leaves are arranged distichously but later they become arranged spirally. At first, up to eight bladeless sheaths develop per plant, followed by the first juvenile foliage leaves 3-6 months after germination. During early growth the stem grows obliquely downwards until it is about 1 m deep in the ground. 
 Nypa fruticans will undergo a fermentation process using yeasts for at least 14 days to extract the bioethanol from it and will be subjected to quality test.",UEP,Main

The incorporation of nanoparticles into composite materials has attracted a great deal of attention due to its ability to enhance polymer properties such as thermal, mechanical and antibacterial. Nano filters have excellent interfacial interactions on polymer branches due to their large specific surface area and high surface energy, thus significantly enhancing the properties of nipa palm starch. In addition, the use of Poly (N-vinyl carbazole) (PVK) is considered a viable method for the prevention of infectious diseases through its antibacterial properties.

Breaking the Silence : The Use of Color Bars,"Beltran, Jermaine V.","Test patterns or ‚Äúcolor bars‚Äù as used by engineers in the television broadcasting industry to check the quality of colors a TV station in broadcasting has evolved in usage and meaning online. In 2017, Facebook timelines of TV5 Network, Inc.‚Äôs current and former employees were inundated with color bars. The color bars became signifiers and symbols of varied emotions as a visual graphic in the online space. Survey and interview of current and laid-off employees of TV5 were utilized to describe the evolving meaning of transcendence of emotions as displayed by visual graphics in the online space. Raising the questions: 1) Are ‚Äúcolor bars‚Äù the new symbol of freedom of expression that connote to struggle and resistance against oppressive broadcasting industries in the online space?, 2) Are these ‚Äúcolors bars,‚Äù as displayed demonstrates assertion of rights in the offline space?, and, 3) If this visual graphic is the new form of resistance, is the broadcasting industry in the Philippines listening? Findings showed that ‚Äúcolor bars‚Äù were used as a form of protest of employees to show their emotional state when they learned that they were laid off from the company. The respondents inadvertently presented these ‚Äúcolor bars‚Äù as signs of grief and solidarity in the online space to display resistance against such company decision.

The scale effect of economic development and freshwater quality in Nigeria: Environmental pollution of the Lower River Niger basin,"Javier, Dymphna","River Niger is the third-longest river in Africa and the longest river in West Africa. The river basin traverses West and Central African countries, and forms a coastal delta (in southern Nigeria) where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The River Niger Basin (RNB) is a crucial asset to development of the West and Central Africa subregions. The RNB ecosystem is currently under heavy degradation of its components due to mutually reinforcing unsustainable socioeconomic development and unregulated urbanization. However, there are limited studies on the pollution of the Lower RNB because of inadequate funding and infrastructure deficit, and existing studies are mainly on the stream tributaries. This paper reviews, for the first time, relevant studies on the Lower RNB and examines the current extent of knowledge regarding the environmental aquatic pollution.

Bifurcation analysis of dengue transmission model in Baguio City,"Addawe, Joel","In this study, we formulate a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of dengue fever in Baguio City, Philippines. We analyzed the existence of the equilibria of the dengue model. We computed and obtained conditions for the existence of the equilibrium states. Stability analysis for the system is carried out for disease free equilibrium. We showed that the system becomes stable under certain conditions of the parameters. A particular parameter is taken and with the use of the Theory of Centre Manifold, the proposed model demonstrates a bifurcation phenomenon.

Parameter optimization of differential evolution algorithm for automatic playlist generation problem,"Addawe, Joel","With the digitalization of music, the number of collection of music increased largely and there is a need to create lists of music that filter the collection according to user preferences, thus giving rise to the Automatic Playlist Generation Problem (APGP). Previous attempts to solve this problem include the use of search and optimization algorithms. If a music database is very large, the algorithm to be used must be able to search the lists thoroughly taking into account the quality of the playlist given a set of user constraints. In this paper we perform an evolutionary meta-heuristic optimization algorithm, Differential Evolution (DE) using different combination of parameter values and select the best performing set when used to solve four standard test functions. Performance of the proposed algorithm is then compared with normal Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a hybrid GA with Tabu Search. Numerical simulations are carried out to show better results from Differential Evolution approach with the optimized parameter values.

Stability and bifurcation analysis of three-species predator-prey model woth monotonic delayed predator response,"Collera, Juancho A.;Balilo, Aldrin","In this paper, we consider delayed three-species predator-prey model with non-monotonic functional response where two predator populations feed on a single prey population. Response function in both predator populations includes a time delay which represents the gestation period of the predator populations. We call a positive equlibrium solution of the form E*S=(x*,y*,y*) as a symmetric equilibrium. The goal of this paper is to determine the effect of the difference in gestation periods of predator populations to the local dynamics of symmetric equilibria. Our results include conditions on the existence of equilibrium solutions, and stability and bifurcations of symmetric equilibria as the gestation periods of predator populations are varied. A numerical bifurcation analysis tool is also used to illustrate our results. Stability switch occurs at a Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, a branch of stable periodic solutions, obtained using numerical continuation, emerges from the Hopf bifurcation. This shows that the predator population with longer gestation period oscillates higher than the predator population with shorter gestation period.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Dynamics of a delayed Intraguild Predation Model in Harvesting,"Collera, Juancho A.;Balilo, Aldrin","In [1], a delayed three-species intraguild predation (IGP) model was considered. This particular tri-trophic community module includes a predator and its prey which share a common basal resource for their sustenance [3]. Here, it is assumed that in the absence of predation, the growth of the basal resource follows the delayed logistic equation. Without delay time, the IGP model in [1] reduces to the system considered in [7] where it was shown that IGP may induce chaos even if the functional responses are linear. Meanwhile, in [2] the delayed IGP model in [1] was generalized to include harvesting. Under the assumption that the basal resource has some economic value, a constant harvesting term on the basal resource was incorporated. However, both models in [1] and [2] use the delay time as the main parameter. In this research, we studied the delayed IGP model in [1] with the addition of linear harvesting term on each of the three species. The dynamical behavior of this system is examined using the harvesting rates as main parameter. In particular, we give conditions on the existence, stability, and bifurcations of equilibrium solutions of this system. This allows us to better understand the effects of harvesting in terms of the survival or extinction of one or more species in our system. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate our results. In fact, we show that the chaotic behavior in [7] unfolds when the harvesting rate parameter is varied.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
An application of seasonal ARIMA models on group commodities to forecast Philippine merchandise exports performance,"Addawe, Rizavel","The increase in the merchandise exports of the country offers information about the Philippines‚Äô trading role within the global economy. Merchandise exports statistics are used to monitor the country‚Äôs overall production that is consumed overseas. This paper investigates the comparison between two models obtained by a) clustering the commodity groups into two based on its proportional contribution to the total exports, and b) treating only the total exports. Different seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models were then developed for the clustered commodities and for the total exports based on the monthly merchandise exports of the Philippines from 2011 to 2016. The data set used in this study was retrieved from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) which is the central statistical authority in the country responsible for primary data collection. A test for significance of the difference between means at 0.05 level of significance was then performed on the forecasts produced. The result indicates that there is a significant difference between the mean of the forecasts of the two models. Moreover, upon a comparison of the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) of the models, it was found that the models used for the clustered groups outperform the model for the total exports.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Lum√°wig: An Efficient Algorithm for Dimension Zero Bottleneck Distance Computation in Topological Data Analysis,"Ignacio, Paul Samuel;Bulauan, Jay-Anne;Uminsky, David","Stability of persistence diagrams under slight perturbations is a key characteristic behind the validity and growing popularity of topological data analysis in exploring real-world data. Central to this stability is the use of Bottleneck distance which entails matching points between diagrams. Instances of use of this metric in practical studies have, however, been few and sparingly far between because of the computational obstruction, especially in dimension zero where the computational cost explodes with the growth of data size. We present a novel efficient algorithm to compute dimension zero bottleneck distance between two persistent diagrams of a specific kind which runs significantly faster and provides significantly sharper approximates with respect to the output of the original algorithm than any other available algorithm. We bypass the overwhelming matching problem in previous implementations of the bottleneck distance, and prove that the zero dimensional bottleneck distance can be recovered from a very small number of matching cases. Partly in keeping with nomenclature traditions in this area of TDA, we name this algorithm Lum√°wig as a nod to a deity in the northern Philippines, where the algorithm was developed. We show that Lum√°wig generally enjoys linear complexity as shown by empirical tests. We also present an application that leverages dimension zero persistence diagrams and the bottleneck distance to produce features for classification tasks.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Uniform exponential stability of a fluid-plate interaction model due to thermal effects,"Peralta, Gilbert","We consider a coupled fluid-thermoelastic plate interaction model. The fluid velocity is modeled by the linearized 3D Navier-Stokes equation while the plate dynamics is described by a thermoelastic Kirchoff system. By eliminating the pressure term, the system is reformulated as an abstract evolution problem and its well-posedness is proved by semigroup methods. The dissipation in the system is due to the diffusion of the fluid and heat components. Uniform stability of the coupled system is established through multipliers and the energy method. The multipliers used for thermoelastic plate models in the literature are modified in accordance to the applicability of a certain Stokes map.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

Notion of ASEAN Citizenship,"Elumbre, Adonis Ramy L.","In 2015, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) was said to have set in motion a regional community with ‚Äúpeace, prosperity, and people‚Äù at the core of its transition towards deeper integration. In 2017, it marked its 50th year - a narrative arc in Southeast Asian history that has arguably defined the region‚Äôs contemporary period. What then could be the next for the organization? This paper explores one of those ideas that has been floating around about ASEAN‚Äôs future in relation to its people-oriented vision. In particular, it enquires into the abstracted and non-legal notion of ‚ÄúASEAN citizenship‚Äù through identification of conjunctures in the development of the organization. While ASEAN‚Äôs lack of a legitimating policy on regional citizenship is understandable given its normative frameworks of intergovernmentalism and non-interference, the paper contends that this notion has already been discursively defined and constructively pursued from within the organization. The resulting narratives on regional identity formation and on ideas and institutions that articulate and generate potential elements of regional citizenship seek to capture aspects of this slippery yet lingering presence of ‚ÄúASEAN citizenship,‚Äù and hopefully contribute to the evolving conversations on the nature and future of ASEAN as it enters a new era.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

Alpha-amylase conjugated biogenic silver nanoparticles as innovative strategy against biofilm-forming multidrug resistant bacteria,"Abeleda, Harold Emman P.;Javier, Athria P.;Murillo, Ann Quincy M.;Q.Baculi, Ronan","The evolution of multidrug resistance in bacteria instigates the decline in effectiveness of antibiotics. Nanoparticle-enzyme bioconjugates are a recent interest in countering biofilm-related infections due to their stability and targeted delivery. The synergistic effect of Œ±-amylase and biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) towards biofilms remains less explored. In this study, we demonstrate the conjugation of Œ±-amylase and AgNPs synthesized using the supernatant of Bacillus horikoshii AJM-A1 and the subsequent application against multidrug resistant biofilms. The biosynthesized AgNPs exhibited an absorbance peak at 400‚Äì470 nm which indicates the typical surface plasmon resonance of AgNPs. SEM-EDX analysis showed irregular and spherical nanoparticles with an average size of 13.47 ¬± 12 nm and high elemental silver. FTIR analysis revealed functional groups in the supernatant involved in reducing Ag+ to AgNP. The AgNPs were conjugated with Œ±-amylase from Bacillus subtilis and the possible modification in the protein's structure was confirmed by fluorescence quenching, FTIR analysis, and absorbance measurements. The bactericidal and antibiofilm efficacies of the AgNPs and bioconjugates were tested against the multidrug-resistant strains Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using varying concentrations (25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 Œºg/mL). The samples showed significant antibacterial activity down to the lowest concentration used and demonstrated significant inhibition of biofilm formation and dispersion of pre-formed biofilms in a dose-dependent manner. The bioconjugates exhibited higher efficiency than AgNPs and Œ±-amylase when used individually against the biofilm-forming strains. This study demonstrates that AgNPs synthesized by alkaliphilic bacterium can be conjugated with Œ±-amylase for potential application against resistant biofilms.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

How Nature Walk Program Affects the Behavior of Children with Learning Disabilities,"Floresca, Jocelyn Alberto","Experience with nature is particularly known to influence a person's health and wellbeing. This case study identified behavioral changes in children with learning disabilities who underwent the Nature Walk Program. An intervention tool designed to let the participants experience nature activities. The study's participants have cases of mild autism and down's syndrome. Undergoing the Nature Walk Program resulted in the increased positive desire to participate in succeeding intervention sessions, improvement in their memory level, and awareness and sensitivity to the natural surroundings. All of these led to positive behavioral changes. Another important factor found in the success of the program as an intervention tool is the facilitators' knowledge in handling the activities, which helps in the success of this endeavor.

"A Female Mixed Martial Arts Fighter ""Road to the Belt""","Floresca, Jocelyn A.;Uy, Gilda Lasat","The inclusion of females in the male-dominated sport of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) has come a long way. Slowly but surely, women in the sport are coming to its prominence. Social changes, combined with adjustment in the society‚Äôs work force, have caused the creation of new spaces, such that women started to occupy sectors that formerly belonged solely to men. This paper looked into the factors contributing to the successful engagement of a Filipina professional fighter in the sport. A qualitative approach was used, specifically employing observation, unstructured interviews, data cross-checking, and netnography, to explore multiple realities of the subject under study. It yielded the following results: no serious personal problems were encountered being a female fighter in professional MMA; acceptance in the community was highly visible, and social media is both an ally and a detractor in the chosen career. Culture, team cohesion, fan support coupled with strong determination, conviction, and hard training were found to be key elements in pursuing the goal. While gender is a factor to be considered in the sport, it was not seen as a diminishing factor in the pursuit of dreams. As a highly televised spectator sport internationally, sports marketing was seen as an important tool in promoting the participation of female athletes in professional MMA. The ‚Äúroad to the belt,‚Äù thus, goes beyond the plan for the title in the ‚Äúbig fight.‚Äù It is, rather, the recognition of the athlete in the pursuit of championing the female in the MMA in the Philippines.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

"Ecological Succession in Areas Covered by Rock Mine Wastes
 in Benguet, Northern Philippines","Cuevas, Virginia C.;Balangcod, Teodora M.","This study analyzed the vegetation in the three sites covered by Cu-rich rock mine wastes in Mankayan, Benguet, Philippines. Site 1 is a topsoil amended tailings pond, site 2 is an unamended tailings pond with only about 10%-24% vegetation cover, and site 3 is an agricultural land that was inundated in 1986 by mine rock wastes. Soil samples were analyzed for pH; texture; and Cu, organic matter (OM), available phosphorus, and exchangeable potassium contents. Results show that site 2 had mean soil Cu level of 220 mg/kg, site 1 had 100 mg/kg, and site 3 had 174 mg/kg. Site 2 had mean soil pH value of 4. Sites 1 and 3 had 66%-75% vegetation cover and soil pH of 6.5 and 5.65, respectively. This study proposes a hypothesis on ecological succession as follows: Digitaria sanguinalis and Paspalum conjugatum community constituted the pioneer stage observed in site 2. Improvement in soil environment led the pioneers to be replaced by Cynodon dactylon and P. conjugatum community in site 1, followed by C. dactylon, P. conjugatum, and Mimosa pudica community in site 3. The increase in soil OM increased the number of species and vegetation cover in the study sites. The soil environments (i.e., texture, OM, high Cu, and low soil pH) of each site determine the plant communities present in each site. Low soil pH increases Cu solubility.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

"An examination of the causes, consequences, and policy responses to the migration of highly trained health personnel from the Philippines: the high cost of living/leaving - a mixed method study","Castro-Palaganas, Erlinda;Spitzer, Denise L.;Kabamalan, Maria Midea M.;Sanchez, Marian C.;Caricativo, Ruel;Runnels, Vivien;Labonte, Ronald;Murphy, Gail Tomblin;Bourgeault, Ivy Lynn","Dramatic increases in the migration of human resources for health (HRH) from developing countries like the Philippines can have consequences on the sustainability of health systems. In this paper, we trace the outflows of HRH from the Philippines, map out its key causes and consequences, and identify relevant policy responses.
 
 Methods
 This mixed method study employed a decentered, comparative approach that involved three phases: (a) a scoping review on health workers‚Äô migration of relevant policy documents and academic literature on health workers‚Äô migration from the Philippines; and primary data collection with (b) 37 key stakeholders and (c) household surveys with seven doctors, 329 nurses, 66 midwives, and 18 physical therapists.
 
 Results
 Filipino health worker migration is best understood within the context of macro-, meso-, and micro-level factors that are situated within the political, economic, and historical/colonial legacy of the country. Underfunding of the health system and un- or underemployment were push factors for migration, as were concerns for security in the Philippines, the ability to practice to full scope or to have opportunities for career advancement. The migration of health workers has both negative and positive consequences for the Philippine health system and its health workers. Stakeholders focused on issues such as on brain drain, gain, and circulation, and on opportunities for knowledge and technology transfer. Concomitantly, migration has resulted in the loss of investment in human capital. The gap in the supply of health workers has affected the quality of care delivered, especially in rural areas. The opening of overseas opportunities has commercialized health education, compromised its quality, and stripped the country of skilled learning facilitators. The social cost of migration has affected √©migr√©s and their families. At the household level, migration has engendered increased consumerism and materialism and fostered dependency on overseas remittances. Addressing these gaps requires time and resources. At the same time, migration is, however, seen by some as an opportunity for professional growth and enhancement, and as a window for drafting more effective national and inter-country policy responses to HRH mobility.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
A Rhetorical Analysis of Isabelo F. de los Reyes's El Tinguian,"Jularbal, Io M.","El Tinguian published in 1888 was considered as the most complete study of the Tinguian at that time; it would mirror travel writings that were produced by Europeans about the region. With its accentuated notions on differentiation and otherings, de los Reyes's ""gaze"" at the Tinguian served as his representation of the ethnolingusitic group to the world. El Tinguian presents itself as indeed a counter-discourse, an attempt to both refute and dispute several notions and nuances that tend to misrepresent the Tinguian. De los Reyes is in a position that shares colonial scientific knowledge with local experience and nativistic thinking which would make one assume that the legitimacy of the text should not even be questioned by anyone in the literary and ethnographic community. But what about the Tinguian? This paper theorizes that the gaze is often utilized on a race that is surmised incapable of speaking for itself. From a postcolonial stance, though himself a Filipino, de los Reyes utilizes a dominating colonial discourse and gazes on an abject other. De los Reyes's defines and transforms the indigenous ""other"" into a set of categories to be utilized by the non-Tinguian as a basis for comparison and differentiation. This paper tackles Isabelo de los Reyes's views and representations of the indigenous ""other"" in his study titled El Tinguian. In writing about the Tinguian, de los Reyes attempts to produce a more localized and nativistic view of the Tinguian which tends to differentiate itself from European writings about the people. But with his use of rhetorical devices in order to give meaning and understanding of the ""other"", his study still delivers itself as an outsider's view of the Tinguian.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Beyond Strategic Maneuvering: Embodied Storytelling as Duterte's Form of Argumentation,"Tatcho, Orville B.","What underscores the appeal of Duterte‚Äôs rhetoric? What is Duterte‚Äôs form of argumentation, and what are its functions and limitations? How can Duterte‚Äôs rhetorical performance inform political campaign discourse in the future? This paper aims to answer these questions through a rhetorical analysis of President Rodrigo Duterte‚Äôs performance in the televised presidential town hall debate of April 2016, co-hosted by television giant ABS-CBN. There is a need to study Duterte‚Äôs rhetoric in the debate to show which among his promises were fulfilled and abandoned. Strategic maneuvering, a framework developed to analyze presidential debates, highlights Duterte‚Äôs promises in the debate with its focus on lines of argument (logos). However, this paper posits that Duterte‚Äôs rhetoric is not primarily based on logos, and there is a need to spotlight his use of ethos and pathos (appeals to credibility and emotions). I argue that Duterte capitalized on embodied storytelling‚Äîa humanizing rhetoric that demystifies the presidency. Through embodied storytelling, Duterte constantly used his identity as a source of narratives that resonate with the public. I explain how Duterte‚Äôs storytelling functions, where it draws its currency and its pitfalls. Finally, I propose rhetorical considerations for future political campaign discourse through factors such as embodiment, identification, resonance, and cultivation.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

"Plants and Culture: Plant utilization among the local communities in Kabayan Benguet Province, Philippines","Balangcod, Teodora D.;Balangcod, Kryssa D.","The Cordillera region occupies a mountainous and forested area in the northern most part of the Philippines. With a favorable temperate climatic regime, the region is endowed with a rich and diverse flora and fauna. Moreover, the region is inhabited by local communities with a diverse culture. With an intimate interaction with the environment, the communities have developed inherent indigenous uses of the plant resources around them. The main aim of this project is to determine the useful plants in Kabayan, Benguet province and document the traditional knowledge that are associated with the useful plants, Kabayan is one of the 13 municipalities in Benguet province. The municipality is predominantly peopled by three ethnolonguistic groups namely: Ibaloi, Kankanaey and Kalanguya, that demonstrate inimitable indigenous knowledge on plant utilization. Ethnobotanical survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire which was used as a guide for the individual interviews and focused group discussions. Plant uses range from food, shelter, clothing, rituals, medicine and many more. They also preserve their dead using various plant extracts. This indigenous knowledge is currently endangered because these are held by the older generation and if not documented, this ethnobotanical knowledge will be irreversibly lost. ¬© 2018, National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR).

Payment for Environmental Services: Application in Landscape Beauty and Recreational Services in the Cordillera Highlands of Northern Philippines,"Abansi, Corazon L.","The application of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) as an economic instrument to promote conservation and poverty reduction goals is relatively young in the Philippines. One of earlier applications is the use of PES schemes for landscape beauty and recreational services in the Cordilleras of Northern Philippines. This paper used the case study approach to analyze the implementation of PES in landscape beauty and recreational services in three indigenous communities of the Cordilleras. The study describes the characteristics of the PES scheme in three tourist destinations(Banaue, Ifugao; Sagada, Mountain Province and Mt. Pulag, Benguet) and identifies the various institutional mechanisms that support markets for environmental services. Evidences of economic, social and environmental impacts are also presented. Highlights of the study pinpoint the importance of ensuring that the design of PES interacts and harmonizes with the cultural setting and existing local resource management institutions. PES implementation must be calibrated to the pace of the changes and transformations taking place within the specific context of the indigenous community. This critical condition in the success of the PES scheme could emerge as inputs to best practices allowing PES to maximize its impacts in terms of both environmental and socio-economic outcomes.

 Cordillera. However, is the richness of the Cordillera natural heritage adequately
 documented to reference the future generation? Therefore, this paper assesses the
 status of biodiversity-related studies in the region and how these data are being shared
 with the public. It highlights the strength of biology in biodiversity studies. We
 gathered biodiversity datasets from various sources such as libraries, research offices,
 universities, and internet search engines with open access. These materials were
 categorized to capture the three levels of organization: genetic,species, and ecosystem
 diversity. The distribution of studies was also assessed based on study sites, and the
 year these were reported. Results show that the accessibility of these biodiversity data
 is deficient and only concentrated in Benguet Province. The majority of the
 biodiversity-related studies in Cordillera are unpublished, with only 54 out of 226
 reviews (24%) reaching the global audience through international publication.
 Available resources were mostly focused on utilizing plants, followed by species
 diversity assessment on limited taxa. An ecosystem approach to the study of flora and
 fauna found in different habitats is wanting. Some of the proposed explanations for
 this dearth of information from a supposedly rich biodiversity area are the lack of
 taxonomic experts and field-based researchers, funding opportunities, publishability
 of taxonomic work, computer databases, inventories, and information networks for
 the collection and collation of information. By data sharing, we know what exists,
 what we are losing, and what we need to conserve.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

"The Event Divides into Two or Parallax of Change: Badiou, Zizek, Bosteels, and Johnson","Agra, Kelly Louise Rexzy P.","This paper takes off from a growing preoccupation in Western political-social philosophy on the thinkability of the materiality of change, that became most pronounced in Alain Badiou's philosophy of the event. It traces the development of the discourse of radical change tied to a materialist theory of subjectivity beginning from Badiou, down to the strong criticism posed against it by Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek. This is then followed by the discussion of Bruno Bosteels' potent defense of Badiou's philosophy. Finally, the last part takes off from this debate and highlights how this tension in Badiou's philosophy was possible in the first place. Using Adrian Johnston's key insight on pre-evental and post-evental time, this paper argues that ≈Ωi≈æek and Bosteels respectively employ pre-evental and post-evental lenses in reading the relation of event to being. Furthermore, these two lenses are themselves the effect of the split readability of the event at the moment of its rupture: the parallax-effect that divides the event into two. This paper asserts that neither of the two is sufficient. Both are fundamental in outlining what sort of sustained disciplines are necessary before and after events take place.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

An Exploration of Schema and the Function of Humor,"Balmores-Paulino, Rozel S.","This paper has qualitatively examined the humor schema and humor functions of selected Filipino residents in Baguio City, Philippines by conducting Focus Group Discussions with Filipino youth, adults and elderly participants. Humor schema can be fleshed out through the cognition of humor and the affective and behavioral dimensions that are linked with it. Humor cognition is associated with the funny person as the primary humor stimulus. The notion of humor has a bias for positive emotions as the expected consequence of the humor experience. The behavioral indices of humor include laughter, specific verbal responses, and both positive and non- normative behaviors. The construal of the non-humorous or the humor threshold is based on the degree to which humor is hurtful to the other; humor is in synchrony with the humor recipient; humor incorporates novelty; the degree of closeness between the source and the recipient; and the perception and context of the recipient. The functions of humor include a mechanism for intervention in times of distress; as a shared activity in social groups and events that strengthens the social bond; as a form of communication, social commentary or forthright challenge to an authority figure; and as an inherent quality of being human.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

The determination ofcoliform bacteria in the Balili River wastewater, agricultural soils irrigated by it,and vegetable, particularly lettuce, Lactuca sativa, grown in these areas were carriedout to serve as indicators of their microbiological quality and potential risks. Bac-teriological counts of the water, soil, and vegetable samples were enumerated viamembrane Ô¨Ålter technique and multiple tube fermentation technique. Primers of thewecA gene, which encode for the protein responsible for the enterobacterial com-mon antigen (ECA), were used for the detection of E. coli by the Polymerase ChainReaction Method.

Discrete Rotating Waves in Neutral Functional Differential Equations: Symmetric CentreManifolds and Bifurcations,"Buono, Pietro-Luciano;Collera, Juancho A.","In this paper, we consider a class of equivariant neutral functional differential equations (NFDEs) with stable D operator. We showthe existence of a centre manifold near periodic solutions with finite spatio-temporal symmetry group (a.k.a discrete rotating waves) invariant with respect to the spatio-temporal symmetry group. This is done by extending a construction of integral manifold near periodic solutions of NFDEs (autonomous and non-autonomous) of Hale and Weedermann (J.

Using this, we show that the symmetry-breaking bifurcation theory for periodic solutions with finite spatio-temporal symmetry group of Lamb and Melbourne (Arch. Rat. Mech.

"Taxonomic diversity, potential growth promoting capacity and eco-physiological drought stress-adaptive mechanisms of root symbiotic fungi (RSF) from Drynaria quercifolia L. and their effects on rice (Oryza sativa L.)","Hipol, Roland","Rice (Oryza sativa L.) needs greater amount of water for its growth and metabolism as compared to other agricultural crops making it vulnerable to drought. Previous studies have suggested that symbiotic fungi can be utilized as exogenous producers of radical scavenging metabolites that enhance the adaptive ability of their host plants exposed to various environmental stresses such as drought. The actual stress-adaptive mechanisms of these root symbiotic fungal (RSF) isolates were tested on drought-stressed rice. The results of the study showed that the five RSF isolates have different mechanisms in protecting rice seedlings against drought. However, one RSF isolate stood out. The rice seedlings treated with the unidentified Mucoromycotina isolate, F9P2RSF21, appeared to have the tallest shoots, 100% germination rate, highest seedling vigor index (SVI) and drought tolerance index (DTI) together with the lowest drought susceptibility index (DSI). Statistical data also revealed that this isolate approximated the plant shoot length, germination rate, SVI, DTI and DSI of those rice seedlings grown in non-drought conditions. These drought parameters showed that the unidentified Mucoromycotina isolate, F9P2RSF21, is the best candidate of this study in combating the far-reaching effects of drought in agriculture. With the apparent consistency in the results pertaining to the potential drought stress tolerance capacity of RSF isolates on Drynaria quercifolia, this study may be a potential breakthrough in the field of agriculture and rice research.

Image Building in the 2016 Philippine Presidential Debates,"Tatcho, Orville B.","Debates are an interesting platform for image building given that they are only partially controlled by the candidates.

Using Fairclough‚Äôs Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Benoit‚Äôs Functional theory of political campaign discourse, this paper argues that mediation shaped and influenced Duterte‚Äôs strategies and topics. Duterte used the dominant strategies of acclaiming and attacking in line with media‚Äôs quest for spectacle and controversy. Moreover, Duterte had more policy pronouncements (issue topics) than character statements (image topics) which resulted in two dominant discourses‚Äîthe discourse of provision and protection. A critique of these discourses reveals that Duterte used the debates to peddle an image of a paternalistic, iron-handed leader who resorted to shortcuts and appeals to expediency at the expense of more informed policy discussions.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

Biosynthesis of Gold Nanoparticles by Bacteria from Hyperalkaline Spring and Evaluation of their Inhibitory Activity Against Pyocyanin Production,"Diego, Kirby D.G. San;Alindayu, Jasper Ian A.;Baculi, Ronan Q.","Nanoparticles are used in wide range of applications given their unique optical, chemical and electronic properties. Microbial biosynthesis of nanoparticles has offered a milder and eco-friendly alternative to physical and chemical methods of synthesis. One potential use of nanoparticles is for the inhibition of quorum sensing-mediated processes by microorganisms during pathogenic colonization and infection. In this study, bacteria from hyperalkaline spring (pH 11) were isolated using various enrichment media. The isolates, phylogenetically related to Lysinibacillus sp. and Pseudomonas stutzeri, were investigated for their ability to biosynthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) via reduction of chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) at pH 9. Extracellular synthesis of gold nanoparticles was confirmed by UV-Vis absorption analysis which showed a peak at 500-600 nm wavelength range corresponding to the surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs. The AuNPs synthesized were of spherical and irregular shapes as revealed by SEM analysis. The presence of elemental gold was further confirmed by EDX analysis. FTIR results showed that various functional groups are possibly involved in the reduction of HAuCl4 and stabilization of synthesized gold nanoparticles. The inhibitory effect of biosynthesized AuNPs was tested on the growth and pyocyanin production of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 during a 72-hour incubation period. Although the biosynthesized AuNPs showed no toxicity to the test organism, an increasing inhibition level of pyocyanin production was observed with increasing volumes of nanoparticles used. The levels of pyocyanin in setups treated with biosynthesized gold nanoparticles at 10, 30 and 50 mL were significantly lower compared to the untreated setups (P ‚â§ 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that bacteria adapted to alkaline conditions can be used for efficient biosynthesis of AuNPs, which exhibited potential biomedical application in inhibiting pyocyanin production.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

UV-Vis spectroscopy was used to study the photocatalytic efficiency of the samples through the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB). UV-Vis measurements show the fast decomposition of methylene blue under UV light illumination with the best degradation efficiency of 97.7% within one hour, achieved with sample ZG2 (1 GO : 2 Zn mass ratio). The corresponding degradation rate was kZG2 = 0.1253 min‚àí1, which is at least 5.5 times better than other existing works using hydrothermal methods. We argue that the excellent photodegradation of MB by ZG2 is due to the efficient charge separation brought about by the electronic interaction of the rGO with the ZnO and the formation of a Zn-O-C bond, as supported by XRD and Raman spectroscopy measurements.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
"A Review of Biodiversity-Related Reports in the Cordillera Highlands, Northern Luzon, Philippines","Baoanan, Zenaida G.;Abansi, Corazon L.;Abalos, Cecilia Fe S.","The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) is not only considered
 as ‚ÄúWatershed Cradle‚Äù but likewise an ‚ÄúEcological Zone‚Äù of Northern Luzon,
 Philippines having the Key Biodiversity Areas. Biological diversity is a precious asset
 for it provides supporting, regulating, provisioning, and culturalservices unique to the
 Cordillera. However, is the richness of the Cordillera natural heritage adequately
 documented to reference the future generation? Therefore, this paper assesses the
 status of biodiversity-related studies in the region and how these data are being shared
 with the public. It highlights the strength of biology in biodiversity studies. We
 gathered biodiversity datasets from various sources such as libraries, research offices,
 universities, and internet search engines with open access. These materials were
 categorized to capture the three levels of organization: genetic,species, and ecosystem
 diversity. The distribution of studies was also assessed based on study sites, and the
 year these were reported. Results show that the accessibility of these biodiversity data
 is deficient and only concentrated in Benguet Province. The majority of the
 biodiversity-related studies in Cordillera are unpublished, with only 54 out of 226
 reviews (24%) reaching the global audience through international publication.
 Available resources were mostly focused on utilizing plants, followed by species
 diversity assessment on limited taxa. An ecosystem approach to the study of flora and
 fauna found in different habitats is wanting. Some of the proposed explanations for
 this dearth of information from a supposedly rich biodiversity area are the lack of
 taxonomic experts and field-based researchers, funding opportunities, publishability
 of taxonomic work, computer databases, inventories, and information networks for
 the collection and collation of information. By data sharing, we know what exists,
 what we are losing, and what we need to conserve.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Modeling Dynamics of Political Parties with Poaching from One Party,"Macansantos, Priscilla","Dynamical social phenomena have been modeled using differential systems employed in mathematical models of epidemiology. In Misra (2012), an epidemiological model is used to study the ‚Äúspread‚Äù of two political parties. In Nyabadzaet. al (2016), the authors point out that the Misra model may be generalized by considering switching between political parties. We take off from these to consider a model in which there are two parties, with a third party recruiting only from one, hence acting as a renegade to one of the two parties. We locate equilibria and consider local stability particularly of the co-existence/endemic equilibrium. Finally, we look at parameter values that result in the recruitment activities of the third party adversely affecting the group it recruits from.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Differential evolution-simulated annealing for multiple sequence alignment,"Addawe, Rizavel;Addawe, Joel","Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) are used in the analysis of molecular evolution and sequence structure relationships. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm, Differential Evolution - Simulated Annealing (DESA) is applied in optimizing multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) based on structural information, non-gaps percentage and totally conserved columns. DESA is a robust algorithm characterized by self-organization, mutation, crossover, and SA-like selection scheme of the strategy parameters. Here, the MSA problem is treated as a multi-objective optimization problem of the hybrid evolutionary algorithm, DESA. Thus, we name the algorithm as DESA-MSA. Simulated sequences and alignments were generated to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of DESA-MSA using different indel sizes, sequence lengths, deletion rates and insertion rates. The proposed hybrid algorithm obtained acceptable solutions particularly for the MSA problem evaluated based on the three objectives.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Forecasting Manila South Harbor Mean Sea Level using Seasonal Arima Models,"Fernandez, Flerida Regine;Rodolfo Po Iii, Neil Montero;Addawe, Rizavel",Global warming has adverse effects which include the rise of the mean sea level.

 feminist (but also decolonial and critical race) studies, which
 interrogates the fundamental role of social identity in knowledge formation.
 The central focus shall be the interrogation of the ways in which power
 relations between social identities create conditions of hermeneutical
 inequality and testimonial privileging and/or marginalization within
 the field of philosophy. Drawing from Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff‚Äôs and
 Elizabeth Potter‚Äôs development of feminist epistemology that no
 longer takes gender as a ‚Äú‚Äòpure‚Äô or solitary influence‚Äù in the
 production, construction, and validation of knowledge, this paper, to

 intellectual curiosity,‚Äù but also to contribute to the emancipatory goal
 of ‚Äúthe expansion of democracy in the production of knowledge,‚Äù with
 specific attention to the practice of academic philosophy. In this sense,
 the paper is feminist in its emancipatory goal; but it aims to liberate

Payment for Ecosystem Services in Mt. Pulag Subwatershed: Policy Implications and Recommendations,"Abansi, Corazon L.","The application of Payment for Environmental Services (PES) as an economic instrument to promote conservation and poverty reduction goals is relatively young in the Philippines. One of earlier applications is the use of PES schemes for landscape beauty and recreational services in the Cordilleras of Northern Philippines. This paper used the case study approach to analyze the implementation of PES in landscape beauty and recreational services in three indigenous communities of the Cordilleras. The study describes the characteristics of the PES scheme in three tourist destinations(Banaue, Ifugao; Sagada, Mountain Province and Mt. Pulag, Benguet) and identifies the various institutional mechanisms that support markets for environmental services. Evidences of economic, social and environmental impacts are also presented. Highlights of the study pinpoint the importance of ensuring that the design of PES interacts and harmonizes with the cultural setting and existing local resource management institutions. PES implementation must be calibrated to the pace of the changes and transformations taking place within the specific context of the indigenous community. This critical condition in the success of the PES scheme could emerge as inputs to best practices allowing PES to maximize its impacts in terms of both environmental and socio-economic outcomes.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

An optical response of 1000 V W-1 was obtained from a 786 nm laser with an output power of 5 mW. The corresponding thermal time constant of 1.8 ms was estimated through the optical response by modulating the laser over a frequency range of 1 Hz-1 kHz. The optical noise equivalent power and optical detectivity of [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] respectively, were estimated from the responsivity, the spectral density, and area of the cell of the absorber, 4.9 √ó 10-4 cm2.

This study is aimed at exploring StAEW as a potential wound care agent and its mechanism. StAEW (pH: 2.65, ORP: 1159 mV, ACC: 32.1 ppm) was sprayed three times a day to the cutaneous wounds of hairless mice for seven days. Wound morphological and histological features and immune-redox markers were compared with saline- (Sal-) and alcohol- (Alc-) treated groups. Results showed that the StAEW group showed a significantly higher wound healing percentage than the Sal group on days 2, 4, 5, and 6 and the Alc group on day 4. The StAEW group also showed earlier mediation on proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL-1Œ≤, and keratinocyte chemoattractant. In addition, basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor were found to be significantly changed in favor of the fibroblast synthesis and angiogenesis. In line, the StAEW group showed a controlled amount of ROS and significantly decreased compared to the Alc group. The StAEW group also favored oxidative stress balance through antioxidant responses. Additionally, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 9 and MMP1 were also modulated for keratinocyte and cell migration. Taken together, this study has proven the wound healing effect of StAEW and its earlier mediation through oxidative and inflammatory responses.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

 bacterium from the sediment of a man-made open-pit mine
 tailings lake in Luneta, Antamok, Itogon, Benguet, Philippines
 for cadmium (Cd) removal. The bacterial strain isolated and
 purified by magnetotaxis using capillary racetrack method and
 grown in the selective medium Magnetospirillum Growth

 MSGM added with different initial Cd concentrations at 0.0,
 0.43, 0.67, 0.98, 1.35, and 1.84 ppm. Cd removal was measured
 through the change in Cd concentration in the cell-free culture
 supernatants using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) at
 time intervals 24, 72, 120, and 168 hours post-inoculation. Cells
 in the presence of Cd grew more favorably than the negative
 control measured at OD600-650nm. Cells grown at 0.67 ppm Cd
 showed the highest cell growth. Furthermore, cell growth was
 still observed at 1.84 ppm exhibiting the highest Cd uptake with
 48.81% decrease in Cd concentration in the cell-free supernatant
 after 24 hours. This suggests that this is the extreme Cd
 concentration tolerated by strain UPB-MAG05 which is 360-

Biodegration of low-density polyethylene by bacteria isolated from serpentinization-driven alkaline spring,"Torre, Denisse Yans Z. Dela;Santos, Lee A. Delos;Reyes, Mari Louise C.;Baculi*, Ronan Q.","Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), a commonly-used packaging material that is resistant to degradation under natural conditions, contributes to environmental pollution. Recently, considerable attention has been focused on microorganisms capable of degrading polyethylene-based plastic waste. In this study, bacterial strains with unique capabilities to use low- density polyethylene as sole carbon source were isolated from a hyperalkaline spring (pH 11) through enrichment culture procedures. The process of biodegradation was observed for 90 days in a synthetic medium containing LDPE films. The bacterial isolates, phylogenetically-affiliated with Bacillus krulwichiae, Bacillus pseudofirmus, Prolinoborus fasciculus, and Bacillus sp., were able to reduce the weight of the residual polymer up to 9.9%, 8.3%, 5.1%, and 6.3%, respectively. The viability of the isolates was correlated with an increased protein density of the biomass. SEM analysis revealed that the strains exhibited strong adhering capabilities as indicated by morphological changes that occurred on the surface of LDPE films incubated with bacterial isolates. Fourier transform infrared spectra showed changes in keto carbonyl index, ester carbonyl bond index, internal double bond index, and vinyl bond index supporting the depolymerization activity of the isolates.Reduction in percent crystallinity of the films incubated with isolates was also observed. This study confirmed the ability of the selected microorganisms to utilize LDPE as carbon source, and to degrade the films without thermal and oxidative pre- treatments.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

This unique optical property of QDs, coupled with their biocompatibility, has caused them to gain attention in biomedicine and be used in gene detection. In this study, cadmium sulfide (CdS) QDs were synthesized by the acidotolerant fungus Trichoderma asperellum, isolated from the main crater lake of Taal Volcano, Batangas, Philippines. UV-Vis and fluorescence spectrophotometry determined absorption maximum at 370 nm and emission maximum at 520 nm while size approximation determined a size of 2.52 nm. Zeta-potential analysis measured an average potential of-23.9 ¬± 3.39 mV. Optimization of reaction conditions revealed promotion of CdS QDs synthesis in the presence of phosphate at neutral conditions after 72 hours of incubation. Fluorescence detection assay conducted with a FAM-labeled leptospirosis-related oligomer demonstrated the occurrence of Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) when addition of CdS QDs resulted to fluorescence quenching. Fluorescence recovery after addition of the target oligomer, down to a concentration of 12 nM supports the use of CdS QDs for gene detection. However, further analysis showed that the detection was only able to differentiate the pyrimidine but not the purine single-base mismatched variant of the target oligomer.

Classification of codimension-one bifurcations in a symmetric laser system,"Collera, Juancho A.","We consider a model of a tetrad of semiconductor lasers with unidirectional coupling. This system is described by Lang-Kobayashi (LK) rate equations, which is a system of delay differential equations with one fixed delay. Basic solutions to this system are called compound laser modes (CLMs). We classify the CLMs of this four-laser system according to their symmetry. The symmetric CLMs are identified by looking at the isotropy subgroups of the symmetry group of this system. Numerical continuation in DDE-Biftool generates a branch of symmetric CLMs. We then find steady-state and Hopf bifurcations along the branch of fully symmetric CLMs and identify those that are symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving. Finally, we use the Equivariant Branching Lemma and Equivariant Hopf Theorem to establish the existence of emanating branches of solutions from symmetry-breaking bifurcations.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

Re-examining Igorot representation: Issues of Commodification and Cultural Appropriation,"Salvador-Amores, Analyn V.","The Igorots, the indigenous communities in North Luzon, Philippines, continue to be hounded to this day, due to the countless photographs and documents whose ultimate purpose was to project the Igorots as the Other. Igorot representation, issues of commodification and cultural appropriation have been, in recent years, one of the most widely discussed sources of ethical problems. The prevalence of these issues indicates the continuing challenge in representing the Igorots. Given a colonial past of appropriation and stereotyping that persists to the present, I argue that representations of Igorot culture are highly contestable and undergoing change: these representations provide a venue for critical examination that permits a deeper awareness of Igorot culture. Colonial records serve as a repository of information that is valuable in restoring aspects of Igorot historical existence. These records are vital in re-examining how Igorots were represented in the past, and how these materials are used in popular modes of representation and recuperation of Igorot identity in the present. This contributes to the self-determination of the Igorots in the contemporary period. Today, modern Igorots often find ways of asserting aspects of their cultural identity, and they draw on their cultural memory as a people to sustain their enduring heritage.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Vernacular self-representation in Filipino gender identities: the Bontoc minamagkit,"Josef, Jennifer C.","This article is an exploration of lived experience of the minamagkit, a vernacular term coined in the 1980s for people of same sex attractions and identities in the Bontoc Mountain Province region of the Philippine Cordilleras. The ethnography traces the emergence of the identity and the label against the backdrop of the Chico River dam conflict and the militarization in the province from the 1970s until the 1990s. I investigate the factors and processes that created the context for the emergence of this self-designating label and the sexual relations between the minamagkit and soldiers stationed in the area. By doing so, I hope to contribute to a more localized, nuanced understanding of gender identities outside of the hegemonic European and even metropolitan-centric discourses on sexual identities.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Love as a Contact Zone: Highland-Lowland Conflict and Negotiation in Three Philippine Cultural Texts,"Pitlongay, Rachel P.","This paper analyzes three Philippine cultural texts that depict highland-lowland romantic relationships with the aim of discovering how romantic discourse is appropriated to investigate the conflict and negotiation of culture. The texts examined are the short story ‚ÄúThe Girl from Bauko‚Äù (Ablang 1988), the TV series Forevermore aired in 2014-2015 by a local Philippine TV station, and the 2006 film Don‚Äôt Give Up on Us.

To address these issues, this paper employs the concept of the ‚Äúcontact zone,‚Äù which is conceptualized here as a space where confrontation, exchange or kinship occurs or is developed.

Queues with Choice: A Symmetry Perspective (Year 1),"Collera, Juancho A.","Recently, a deterministic queueing model where in customers are given the opportunity to choose between two queues was introduced. The information provided to the customers is not up-to-date but instead customers were given the queue length information some time units in the past. This time delay impacts the dynamical behavior of the queues and hence the decision-making process of the customers. We revisit this queues-with-choice model from a symmetry perspective. We show that the symmetry structure of the model can be used to classify the types and kinds of solutions that can occur. In particular, our results explain why only asynchronous periodic solutions and symmetric equilibrium solutions arise in such model, while synchronous periodic solutions and asymmetric equilibrium solutions do not occur. Our method can also be applied to study similar models with larger number of queues.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

DDE-Biftool, which is a Matlab package for numerical continuation and numerical bifurcation analysis of DDEs, is one of the most utilized and popular numerical tools for DDEs. In this paper, we present a guide to using the latest version of DDE-Biftool targeted to researchers who are new to the study of time delay systems. A short discussion of an example application, which is a harvested predator-prey model with a single discrete time delay, will be presented first. We then implement this example model in DDE-Biftool, pointing out features where beginners need to be cautious. We end with a comparison of our theoretical and numerical results.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Mathematical Analysis of Predation of Rice Plants and weeds by invasive Golden Apple Snail (Pomacea canaliculata) with Harvesting,"Addawe, Joel M.;Baoanan, Zenaida G.;Addawe, Rizavel C.","Golden Apple Snail(GAS) (Pomacea canaliculata), popularly known in the Philippines as ‚Äúgolden kuhol‚Äù is considered a serious invader in a paddy ecosystem. Rice farmers consider it as a notorious invasive species and a serious pest in several rice farms. In this study, we model the predation of rice plants and weeds by GAS. We formulate three ordinary differential equations to model the simplified dynamics of apple snails, rice plants and weeds in the presence of harvesting on snails. We then investigate the mathematical features of the model and analyze the stability of equilibria. Actual death and harvesting rates on GAS gathered from actual field experiments conducted on the enclosed rice paddies are used for the parameters in the numerical simulations to demonstrate the potential effect of snail harvesting.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Dynamic of a Stage-Structured Intraguild Predation Model,"Collera, Juancho A.;Magpantay, Felicia Maria G.","In this paper, we consider a three-species intraguild predation (IGP) model which includes a predator (IG predator) and its prey (IG prey) that share a common resource, and where the IG prey population is partitioned into juvenile and adult stages. The juvenile IG prey are assumed to have little ability for predation and are able to avoid the IG predators by taking refuge. The maturation age of the IG prey population is reflected by a time delay. Conditions for the existence and local stability of all non-negative equilibria are given using the delay as the main parameter. In particular, we show that the positive equilibrium may switch stability at some critical delay value where a Hopf bifurcation occurs. However, this does not lead to destabilization of the system since the stability of the positive equilibrium is passed on to the limit cycle that is created via the Hopf bifurcation. In other words, the introduction of stage structure on the IG prey population enhances the species coexistence through the emergence of limit cycles.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
"Plant growth-promoting characteristics of root fungal endophytes
 isolated from a traditional Cordillera rice landrace","Chd, Pablo;Jrr, Pagaduan;Hkc, Langres;Rm, Hipol","This study was conducted to isolate and characterize the plant growth-promoting potential of fungal endophytes from the roots of Diket red, a traditional rice plant from the Cordillera, Northern Luzon. Eighteen morphospecies of filamentous endophytes were isolated of which twelve isolates were successfully identified to the species level. These isolates were identified as Aspergillus versicolor, Aspergillus sp., Chaetosphaeria sp., Cladosporium cladosporioides, Hypocrea lixii, Microascus murinus, and Trichoderma harzianum. The identified twelve isolates were selected to screen in vitro for their plant growth-promoting characteristics, and evaluated in vivo for their beneficial effects on seedling vigor and early seedling growth. Isolate PPL14 produced the highest IAA at 55.5 Œºg ml-1 and M. murinus PPL10 produced the highest amount of IAA at 3.73 Œºg IAA mg-1 dry mycelia wt. The seedling vigor assay and in vivo plant growth promotion bioassay indicated overall positive effects of culture filtrate (CF) application of the endophyte isolates. Rice seeds and seedlings grown in aseptic condition and treated with endophyte CFs displayed significantly enhanced levels of germination, seedling vigor, shoot, root, and total plant growth, and biomass compared to non-treated control. Other plant growth-promoting characteristics were also studied including phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, ammonia production, and catalase activity. This study supports the potential use of fungal endophytes as bio-inoculants for plant growth promotion and enhancement of nutrient assimilation of agriculturally important crops.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Enigmatic Geometric Tattoos of the Butbut Kalinga,"Salvador-Amores, Analyn V.","There is an outpouring of local and foreign tourists flocking to the remote village of Buscalan in Tinglayan, Southern Kalinga, a mountainous region of the Cordillera located in Northern Luzon, Philippines. The main purpose of their visit is to get bato¬¥k‚Äîtraditional tattoos, which are permanent inscriptions embedded in the skin‚Äîfrom Whang-ud Oggay, the ninety-year-old tattoo practitioner whose story has left a mark on everyone who has heard it. To reach the village of Whang-ud, you will have to undertake an arduous journey: ten hours from Metro Manila (capital region of the Philippines) to Bontoc, three hours from Bontoc to Kalinga, one hour by motorbike, and another hour of trekking to reach the village of Buscalan, where the Butbut community reside (see Figure 1 for a map). But visitors find it worth the trip: the tattooing of small designs on their legs, backs, arms, and wrists is done in less than an hour, and they bring the tattoos back to the cities as souvenirs of another culture, as representations of themselves. The bato¬¥k of the Butbut are known for their elaborate symmetric designs, which include geometric patterns and friezes. In the village of Buscalan and in other Butbut communities in Tinglayan such as Bugnay, Butbut proper, Lokkong, and Ngibat, you may find elders who are tattooed with traditional designs. Tattooing thrives only in the village of Buscalan, however, where younger apprentices are mentored by Whang-ud. It is an unforgettable experience to witness the tattooing process and catch a glimpse of the bato¬¥k on the bodies of the Butbut, which serve as a living testament to one of the oldest cultural tattooing practices in the world.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Biodegradation of High Density Polyethylene by Bacteria Isolated from Root Nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris,"Baculi, Ronan","Plastics are synthetic polymers commonly used as packaging materials. The rapid rise in the use of plastic materials without corresponding development of procedures for its proper disposal poses a threat to terrestrial and marine environments. High density polyethylene (HDPE), a common component of packaging materials, is naturally-resistant to degradation and causes long-term environmental pollution. Biodegradation is an alternative process for waste disposal that taps the potential of microorganisms. This study aimed to assess the potential of bacteria isolated from root nodules of Phaseolus vulgaris, an established plant and microbe association, to degrade plastic material such as HDPE. Analysis showed that the isolates have the capability to physically and chemically modify plastic materials. Bacterial isolates, identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens and Serratia marcescens, were capable of reducing the weight of the plastic material after 90 days of incubation. On the other hand, visualization of surface morphologies of the HDPE films with the bacterial isolates showed the presence of surface changes characterized by pits, cracks, and surface roughness. The change in physical properties of the material was further supported by chemical changes in the polymer through the appearance and disappearance of certain chemical groups. The degradation of the material is attributed to bacterial activity via adhesion on surfaces and use of enzymes by the bacterial isolates to use the plastic as nutrient source. This eco-friendly approach has the potential to enhance the disposal of plastic materials in the environment.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Reflexivity in Qualitative Research: A Journey of Learning,"Castro-Palaganas, Erlinda;Sanchez, Marian C.;Molintas, Ma.

"Ecological succession in areas covered by rock mine wastes in Benguet, Northern Philippines","Cuevas, V.C.;Balangcod, T.M.","This study analyzed the vegetation in the three sites covered by Cu-rich rock mine wastes in Mankayan, Benguet, Philippines. Site 1 is a topsoil amended tailings pond, site 2 is an unamended tailings pond with only about 10%-24% vegetation cover, and site 3 is an agricultural land that was inundated in 1986 by mine rock wastes. Soil samples were analyzed for pH; texture; and Cu, organic matter (OM), available phosphorus, and exchangeable potassium contents. Results show that site 2 had mean soil Cu level of 220 mg/kg, site 1 had 100 mg/kg, and site 3 had 174 mg/kg. Site 2 had mean soil pH value of 4. Sites 1 and 3 had 66%-75% vegetation cover and soil pH of 6.5 and 5.65, respectively. This study proposes a hypothesis on ecological succession as follows: Digitaria sanguinalis and Paspalum conjugatum community constituted the pioneer stage observed in site 2. Improvement in soil environment led the pioneers to be replaced by Cynodon dactylon and P. conjugatum community in site 1, followed by C. dactylon, P. conjugatum, and Mimosa pudica community in site 3. The increase in soil OM increased the number of species and vegetation cover in the study sites. The soil environments (i.e., texture, OM, high Cu, and low soil pH) of each site determine the plant communities present in each site. Low soil pH increases Cu solubility.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

"Through Indigenous Lenses: ""Ecotopia According to Vernacular Music Videos from Benguet, Philippines""","Telles, Jason Paolo R.","The indigenous groups in Benguet, Philippines, have begun to produce their own music videos and other media products to express themselves and to correct ill-informed portrayals about them. Through such, they have achieved self-representation by textualizing their cultures and worldviews, including their perspectives on the natural world and its ideal state. Employing a textual analysis that is grounded on the concepts of postcolonial appropriation and Ginsburg et al.‚Äôs ‚Äúscreen memories,‚Äù this article discusses how two indigenous-produced music videos, which tackle the environment, represent their imaginations of an ecotopia. These, once recognized in environmental discourse, would ideally result in the formulation of more effective, cost-efficient, and socially just environmental plans and practices. As the world clamors for a sustainable and more ideal state of the planet, exploring indigenous perspectives on an ecotopia could be beneficial, as they may provide legitimate, ethical, and context-appropriate alternatives that have been neglected due to ‚Äúothering.‚Äù",UP-Baguio,Baguio
"Laws, Institutional Arrangements, and Policy Instruments","Abansi, Corazon L.","The chapter maps the array of formal arrangements between water apex bodies, national government agencies, local government units and water organizations with mandates on water supply and demand management. Institutional arrangements are complex, multilayered and fragmented, with duplication of tasks such as planning and monitoring, whilst few are involved in operations and financing. Local government units directly operate facilities and replicate the work of water apex bodies, which have no local presence. The role of the state is central as owner of property rights to water, regulator and subsidy provider. Despite increasing private sector participation in water provisioning mainly in urban centers, many rural and village-level waterworks continue to rely on grants from the government for crucial infrastructure, operations and management funds. The government uses water permits, subsidy, legal requirements for inter-sector transfer, and penalties for pollution as policy instruments. However, serious gaps remain as mechanisms are not fully articulated in order to meet social equity and resource sustainability goals. The outcomes are highly localized, politically contingent, and diverse water governance schemes. Select cases illustrate how the absence of clear property rights and rules for orderly contracting lead to political mobilization for preferred outcomes, local social arrangements, and water pricing innovations.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Water Demand Management and Improving Access to Water,"Abansi, Corazon L.","he chapter reviews and examines water-related program interventions‚Äìsocial, economic, institutional‚Äìthat have directly and indirectly influenced water demand management in the Philippines since 2000. Demand focuses on water users and the human dimensions of water use, including degradation of water quality, excessive drawing from aquifers, non-consumptive uses of water, and the organizations that have evolved to represent the various stakeholders. The chapter then examines the feasibility of the emergent emphasis on policies that stress making better use of existing supplies in combination with decentralization and participation of water users, even as new sources are explored. Initiatives by the Department of Interior and Local Government toward expanding water access in areas not served by municipal water districts, participatory management schemes for irrigation associations by the National Irrigation Administration, and intersectoral formation for surface water/river quality management by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources are probed. The chapter describes initiatives such as intermunicipal water transfers, independent community-based collective arrangements for domestic and irrigation provisioning (through cooperatives) and riparian upstream-downstream coalitions for water quality in select locality cases. Such policies and interventions aim to influence demand along principles of efficiency, equity, and sustainability. This chapter explores the application of water-demand programs by select national government agencies to their respective client-groups. The institutional arrangements thus created by these program applications are ‚Äúgrey area‚Äù because they are not as yet grounded on water rights or adequately covered in the existing Philippine Water Code. But they portend to better/improved ways by which water can be more equitably accessed.",UP-Baguio,Baguio
Erythromycin in Exposure Disrupts the Life Cycle Stages of Aedes Aegypti L. (Diptera: Culicidae),"Calma, Mayer L.;Asiss, Joannes Luke B.;Medina, Paul Mark B.","Erythromycin is one of the most widely used antibiotics globally and is considered an emerging contaminant in wastewaters and environmental waters. The egg, larval, and pupal stages of the dengue vector Aedes aegypti L. reside and develop in aquatic environments. These mosquito stages may be exposed to compounds in the water, such as erythromycin. Aquatic stages of Ae. aegypti were reared in different concentrations of erythromycin which resulted in significant delay and decrease in eclosion of eggs and pupation of larvae (P < 0.05). Moreover, emergence of adults from pupae, larval survival, and adult female fecundity significantly decreased (P < 0.05). A few occurrences of hypopigmentation in larvae and blisters in adult mosquitoes were also observed. Interestingly, second-generation eggs, which were laid by adult female mosquitoes exposed to erythromycin during their aquatic stages, did not exhibit decreased levels of eclosion in the presence of erythromycin. These results reveal that long-term erythromycin exposure disrupts the Ae. aegypti life cycle by decreasing survival and delaying progression throughout different life stages. However, this study demonstrates that Ae. aegypti can rapidly acquire significant tolerance to the emerging environmental contaminant erythromycin within two generations.",UP-Baguio,Baguio

This is however not applicable to all ages. Individuals from 0 to 8 years old and adults older than 45 years old remain susceptible to the vector-borne disease dengue. Forecasting future dengue cases accurately from susceptible age groups would aid in the efforts to prevent further increase in dengue infections. For the age groups of individuals not eligible for vaccination, the presence of outliers was observed and was treated using winsorization, square root, and logarithmic transformations to create a SARIMA model. The best model for the age group 0 to 8 years old was found to be ARIMA(13,1,0)(1,0,0)12 with 10 fixed variables using square root transformation with a 95% winsorization, and the best model for the age group older than 45 years old is ARIMA(7,1,0)(1,0,0)12 with 5 fixed variables using logarithmic transformation with 90% winsorization.

"Sustainable Philippine Cavendish Banana Value Chain: Exploring Local Markets and Processed Product Development 
 
 Project Components:
 1. Value Chain Analysis: Local Market Demand for Cavendish Banana Substitute Products
 2. Assessment of Existing, and Development of New or Improved, Production Process and Food Products from Cavendish Banana Rejects
 3. Chain Network Modelling of Philippine Cavendish Banana under Uncertainty","Digal, Larry N.","The goal of the project is to contribute to enhancing income of small cavendish banana producers and
 enterprises by understanding the issues that affect their income in order to develop strategic solutions
 to these issues. Previous solutions to improve the economic conditions of small banana farmers
 especially after the implementation of agrarian reform where ownership of large commercial farms was
 transferred to small farmers include implementing support service programs. Organizing farmer
 beneficiaries to cooperatives to avoid fragmenting these commercial farms and facilitating access to
 credit and technology are some examples. Despite these, others continue to struggle especially with the
 impact of climate change and the outburst of panama disease (fusarium). Highly affected are those
 supplying to spot markets (non-contracted) since technical assistance and credit are usually not provided
 by the buyers unlike those under contracts. While agricultural venture agreements (growership and
 lease) have been forged between agrarian reform beneficiaries and their buyers who are mostly
 multinational firms, issues continue to exist, not so much on technical assistance, but mainly on equity,
 risks and profitability (World Bank 2015; 2016). An example of this equity issue is the altercation
 between Speaker Alvarez and Congressman Floirendo published in PDI March 28, 2017 regarding the
 lease contract between Tadeco (Tagum Development Corporation) and Bureau of Corrections. It was
 alleged that this contract is onerous since the lease rental paid by Tadeco is way below market price.
 Another is polevaulting (selling outside contract) which is partly due to low contract price per box of
 banana.
 Given these issues, this research project aims to contribute to improving income of small producers and
 enterprises and equity in the chain by exploring alternative markets for small farmers such as local
 markets particularly supemmrkets for both fresh and processed products. The project will also cover
 women as participants in the value chain. Based on previous studies, women participation was limited
 to banana packing only. In the processing of banana rejects, majority of the workers are housewives of
 Cavendish banana smallholders and laborers.
 Profitability of enterprises and the equitable distribution of income in the value chain are affected by
 the internal and external environments of all enterprises in the chain network. The internal factors
 include quality and productivity of products (fresh and processed products) in the production,
 processing and retail nodes of the chains while external factors include the competitors and substitutes
 including the policy environment. This research aims to 1) Analyze the value chain of Cavendish banana
 chains involving small scale producers in the production of fresh and processed products 2) Examine
 the factors (internal and external) that affect income of small scale Cavendish banana producers in the
 production fresh and processed products including retail 3) Construct and estimate models to analyze
 the factors that affect performance of players in the value chain networks in terms of efficiency and
 equity 4) Develop interventions to improve quality and performance of products of small scale
 producers 5) Identify strategic options including policy implications to enhance income and equitable
 distribution of benefits in the chain.
 Based on the literature and own knowledge, few studies have been done to address these objectives
 particularly in the case of Cavendish banana. Gaps also exist in terms of the methodology and models
 to address these objectives. While there have been models developed in analyzing demand, supply and
 costs under uncertainty within the supply chain network design (SCND) literature, no study has been
 done complementing these models with demand analysis of branded products using point of sale data
 at the retail (supermarket) node of the chain. In addition, examining performance of the chain
 particularly in terms of equity and efficiency have not been well studied especially within the SCND
 literature under uncertainty (Govindan et al 2017). This research will use a value chain analysis
 framework employing qualitative and quantitative models such as optimization and econometric models
 dealing with uncertainty (component 1 and 3). This will lead to identification of issues and challenges

"Where water flows: Characterizing domestic water and the institutional arrangements for provisioning and access in two Visayas island-settings
 
 Project Components:
 1. Characterization of domestic water supply (physico-chemical and microbiological parameters) and use patterns in community-based Level 2 and 3 systems with varying ecologies
 2. Characterization of institutional arrangements (property rights to water and holders of property rights) and their link to domestic water resource sustainability and access
 3. Design, formulation and transfer of decision support system (DSS) tool and operations manual for water managers of community-run and local government-run Level 2 and 3 water systems.","Arcala-Hall, Rosalie","The proposed project examines the bio-physical characteristics of domestic water source (supply-side) and the governance arrangements for use and access (demand-side) in rural communities with varying ecologies‚Äî upland, midstream and coastal- in the Visayas region. It builds a comparative profile of the surface water sources for domestic use and for drinking,
 describes how it is consumed, and the wastewater discharge practices of 3 user types- households, small and medium enterprises for material processing, and local business establishments. The institutional arrangements- rule based and socially sanctioned‚Äî underpinning use and access, specifically, property rights to water On tine with Schlager and Ostrom's (1992) categories of access, withdrawal, exclusion, management and alienation) and the holder of such rights (private,communal or state/government) are analyzed.
 
 The project overall goal is to improve access of quality domestic water at the community level by way of building locale-specific empirical data and recommending concrete policy mechanisms for monitoring, regulation of water extraction and point-source pollution, and orderly contracting for water provisioning that benefit the poor. There are four objectives: (1) Characterize domestic water supply by locating/mapping sources in terms of capacity and quality (physico-chemical and microbiological parameters) in three distinct ecologies (upland, midstream and lowland; (2) Describe patterns of use and access by households, small-and-medium size industries, and local business establishments and wastewater discharge from their consumption activities; (3) Compare profiles of institutional arrangements (property rights to water and holders of property rights) and their link to resource sustainability and access; (4) Generate concrete local policy mechanisms to effect improved domestic water sustainability and access. The project's key hypothesis is that use and access are affected by the interaction of the bio-physical environment and institutional arrangements. User-communities with more robust collective arrangements for water resource protection and sharing are better able to meet the challenge of scarcity.
 
 The proposed research has a comparative design. The biophysical water profiles will be arrayed alongside socio-demographic variables and corresponding institutional use and access arrangements among water-source-clustered households and enterprises. Data collected will include volumetric capacity of the water source); biochemical and microbiological properties of the water supply; extent of protection, age and accessibility to contaminants of the water source;
 behavioral dynamics in using water and disposing of wastewater; and knowledge, understanding and values attached to water as property. The research locales are 15 sample communities in Guimaras island province, with equal number of replicates in Leyte.
 Several methodologies will be employed: (1) water source quality sampling and laboratory-testing; (2) a self-administered survey of combined 300 households, small-and-medium enterprise and local business establishments on the harvest, and protection system; (3) Focus Group Discussions (FGD) with stakeholders to surface socio-behavioral dynamics of water use, am:Ks and wastewater discharge; (4) key informant interviews with the water organization manager, and water infrastructure funder; and (5) review of secondary data such as water organization budget and accomplishment reports, related local ordinances contracts, memorandum of agreements (Art0A), and barangay government documents.
 This study aims to contribute to the dearth of locality studies and empirical data on community-based organization (CB0) and LGU-run domestic water systems operating on Level II (communal or public faucets) and Level ill (fully-reticulated
 individual household connection), which comprise the bulk of the National Water Registry of the National Water Resources Board (NWRB). It is an interdisciplinary endeavor marrying expertise in chemistry, management, public policy, and information technology.
 The proposal builds upon current efforts at developing core faculties' research credentials towards a Master of Science (MS) in Sustainabitity Science, an interdisciplinary degree that merges both natural and social sciences expertise of UP Visayas. It also builds undergraduate instruction on thesis/special project methods by field exposure to the proposed
 project sites, and laboratory test protocols. Two (2) UP Visayas PhD students (Doctor of Public Administration; PhD in Marine Affairs) whose dissertation topics are on water administration/management, will be coached through their participation in the project.",UP-Visayas,Visayas
"Marine Fisheries Assessment of Panay: Building Local Fisheries Information through Research Capability Enhancement in HEIs
 
 Project Components:
 1. Discovering species diversity of marine fishes in Panay Island, Philippines 
 2. Standardization of protocols for estimating catch per unit effort by municipal and commercial fisheries in Panay Island, Philippines 
 3. Study on Chemical composition of marine fishes","Babaran, Ricardo","The success of resource management and conservation initiatives depends mainly on the availability of reliable
 data about the resource and its utilization. The lack of such information about Philippine marine fishery resources
 has resulted in failures of conservation and management measures to solve complex conservation issues. This
 project aims to tackle this problem by mobilizing a collaboration of Philippine HEls in Panay Island with fisheries
 program to carry out research activities that would address issues concerning the availability of local fisheries
 data. This consortium will serve as a platform for implementing of strategic inter-disciplinary research approach
 to ensure the success of the project. More specifically, this project involves an integrated program of research
 that deals with key issues in Philippine marine fisheries within each of the three components:
 Component 1: Discovering Species Diversity of Marine Fishes in Panay Island, Philippines
 This component aims to record the marine fish species in Panay Philippines, thereby providing practical fish
 species identification methods. It will be a follow-up of our previous work (Motomura et al. 2017) on documentation
 of marine fishes of Panay. In that work, we documented around 600 species of marine fishes from market surveys
 in Southern Iloilo and Southern Antique. In this project, we are planning to extend the sampling to fisheries surveys
 and to study other sites in Panay (Western Antique and Northern 1161o), to produce a more comprehensive record
 of marine fish biodiversity in Panay Island.
 Component 2: Standardization of Protocols for Estimating Catch per Unit Effort by Municipal and Commercial
 Fisheries in Panay Island. Philippines
 This component aims to implement a reliable practical method (e.g., Sparre 2000; Mills et al. 2007) for estimating
 CPUE of municipal and commercial fisheries in Panay Island, Philippines. Accurate catch and effort data will be
 generated using standard protocols devised by the proponents based on state-of-the-art methods in the field (e.g.,
 electronic monitoring of effort using GPS data loggers). Data from this approach will be compared to those

 Aquatic Resources will be made, at least to have access to data for comparison purposes. Where necessary
 comparative field sampling activities will be conducted. This comparison is expected reveal the issues with the
 NSAP protocols that should be addressed.
 Component 3: Chemical Composition of Marine Fishes
 The importance of marine fishery resources hinges mainly on their potential nutritional and industrial values.
 However, this aspect of Philippines marine fisheries is not well investigated, especially regarding the low-value
 species. This component aims to address this issue by determining basic nutritional parameters (proximate and
 fatty acid compositions, and energy and mineral contents) of marine fishes in Panay, and characterizing
 industrially important compounds (collagen, gelatin, and hydroxyapatite) that can be extracted These data can
 be used in developing technologies for the valorization of the low-value fishery resources.
 This project presents a strategic approach towards capability building and institutional strengthening for Philippine
 marine fisheries research, development and extension (RDE). The ROE will generate new and important
 knowledge about the Philippine marine fisheries, while serving as a platform for training of professionals in skills
 in marine fisheries research and management. We envision that implementing this and similar projects will support
 building up of pool of experts and systems that can help address complex issues in Philippine marine fisheries.
 Ultimately, outputs of such ROE will allow us to better understand the status of Philippine marine fisheries and
 provide guidance for a more effective, context-specific management and conservation measures.",UP-Visayas,Visayas

 As can be seen, fabrication of Protective Face Shield (PFS) is the main activity which this study will accomplish. This activity will be produced and distributed
 (output) to the beneficiaries (frontliners and students). Consequently, this project will lessen the rampant problem in which the government is facing at the
 moment, the scarcity of supply of PFS that is vital for the protection and prevention of the spread if the disease (COVID- 19), as well as treatment for the
 patients diagnosed as Positive, PUI and PUM or as Suspect, Probable or Confirmed cases (revised classification of individuals given by World Health Organization,
 March 20, 2020). With this venture, the University can help in alleviating the increasing rate of COVID-19 transmission across the Davao region.
 
 The project shall be based at the Digihub FabLab of the College of Technology in the University of Southeastern Philippines (USeP). A shared service facility
 with its agency partners, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and Department of Science and Technology (DOST).
 The fabrication of the PFS shall follow the safety protocol and guidelines of the Fabrication Laboratory. It shall abide with the safety protocol as stipulated
 in USeP ISO 9001:2015.
 Distribution Plan
 In the distribution of PFS the following steps shall be observed to ensure that all distribution activities shall be in accordance with COA rules. It shall also
 consider equity in the distribution of the equipment.
 1. USeP Action Center shall coordinate with all beneficiaries through email/text message on the details of their respective communities (i.e. number of
 frontliners, number of students, number of PFS needed).
 2. Project team shall prioritize recipients based on criteria (e.g. number of cases (PUMs and PUIs, availability of PPEs, etc.)
 3. Project team shall prepare schedule of deliveries or pick-up schedule.
 4. Project team shall prepare acknowledgment receipts (format shall be based on COA requirements)

 b. It can be head of checkpoint.
 5. Other supporting documents shall include pictures of the turn-over or video.
 6. Acceptance receipt shall include full name of receiving officer, including contact details, dates and fresh signature.
 Sustainability Plan
 In order to sustain the project, the facilitation of these three (3) activities is vital: (1) Promotion, (2) Student Entrepreneurship, and (3) Research.
 Promotion. This activity supports or provides active encouragement to increase public awareness, which consequently will increase demands of
 the finished product. If the public is aware that the University through its Fabrication Laboratory is fabricating such products, then it will be easy for the
 University to use it as an Income Generating Project (IGP) during this crisis only. The donation itself is already one way of promoting the products not only
 to the mass but also to the hospitals and LGUs, including the frontliners. Sales will take place after the pandemic. The mere fact that the public is already
 aware that the University can manufacture such products, USeP can now put value (price) on each product produced. The sales will now be used for
 another round of fabrication.
 Student Entrepreneurship. This activity allows students to learn more than just their chosen field of study, and creates an interdisciplinary environment to
 work and develop in. The network and friendships which develop help students to become better connected once they leave the University and help
 them prepare for long term success. The University will tap the students aligned with business-related courses such as BS in Entrepreneurship and BS in
 Business Administration. These students will help in promoting and selling the fabricated products.
 Research. Through research, the University shall be able to make innovation on the existing product or may create other products essential for mitigation

 6. Report Generation from Administered Project CLEAR Website for HEls and Tech Voc Schools: Database of student experiences as a source of report generation for data analytics.","Castro, Belinda V. De","The CHED Memorandum No. 52, s. 2016 has for its subject ""Pathways to equity, relevance and advancement in
 research innovation, and extension in Philippine higher education."" This CHED memo served as impetus to doing a
 national survey (online database) that will probably create an online survey management system and website depicting
 the landscape of higher education in the country focusing on the undergraduate students' experiences in the HEls
 (represented by PHERNET and HERRC schools) and the TechVoc students in the TESDA schools. Using the QM
 framework used by the Australian higher education institutions as basis, this study will hopefully serve as barometer
 of the quality of education that is being offered in the country. This will eventually show which schools can possibly
 offer quality education per academic program and could likewise assist students and parents when choosing a school
 and career after basic education.
 The Qilt system will serve as basis for the creation of the country's own online system of data collection for Project
 CLEAR for long-term plans of attaining the objectives of the project. This will be done in order for the education sector
 to be more responsive to the industry needs. The study can likewise provide a good measure of the success and
 relevance of the outcomes-based education and the K to 12 curriculum implementation. Comparative studies of liEls
 among regions and countries can also be done since there are also other countries using a similar system for data
 generation.
 The study will employ a descriptive exploratory comparative design. Researchers will adapt the survey in the Qilt
 framework revising some questions to make it more relevant to the current needs and situation of the country. Only
 PHERNet and HERRC schools will be included in the first implementation of the online system to establish its validity
 and reliability prior to a more encompassing nationwide survey. The use of crowd sourcing through the social network
 will be used as a data gathering tool to prompt more participation in the study. Data analytics (both visual and
 computational) will be done to achieve the objectives of the study through the UST-Research Center for Social
 Sciences and Education (RCSSED) in charge of the reports generation
 The totality of Project CLEAR which intends to surface students' experiences from enrollment to employment may be
 accomplished in four years' time frame. The study will actually consist of four (4) phases, namely: (1) Students'
 Experience Survey, (2) HEls' Quality of Education and Research, (3) Graduate Employment and Employability, and
 (4) Employer Satisfaction Survey. Project CLEAR is also intended to be a longitudinal study where the student
 respondents who will be involved in the current study will hopefully be the graduates and employees to be considered
 in the future studies for phases 3 and 4. Thus, a more holistic view of the quality of education could be seen from
 enrollment to employment of the same batch of respondents. Further, the totality of this study will eventually show
 which curriculum programs are more employable and are more relevant in the workplace, and which skills are more
 needed by the industry. This will likewise create a mechanism that can compare graduates of the old and new higher
 education curricula since it will involve students for AY 2018-19 who will be in their 15t and 4th or 5th years of college
 education.
 Additionally, the totality of this study (phase 2) aims to create a registry of researchers that would provide a pipeline of
 human resources in research thus sustaining research careers in the Ha Educational institutions in the country have
 their own pool of expert researchers that are seldom utilized by other schools due to the lack of a nationwide network
 that links them together. This lack of a nationwide database of researchers deters researchers from other areas to tap
 other fellow researchers for collaboration, expert advices, sharing of resources and networking.
 In connection with the over-all focus of the study, however, only the first phase on the students' experience in HEls
 and TESDA schools will be done for the first two years of Project CLEAR.
 Intellectual merit of the proposed activity
 This will provide a landscape of the state of education and research in the country in all disciplines from the soft and
 hard sciences and a comparative map using data analytics of the variables in the study.
 Impact on hiaher education
 The study will be significant to CHED and TESDA on which academic and tech-voc programs to offer, how to improve
 the quality of education in each HEI and TESDA techvoc schools. This will likewise provide a mechanism to compare
 experiences of students in the old and new curriculum in higher education. The website that will be created will be
 significant to student and parent stakeholders for comparison of HEls and academic programs to choose.
 Wider impact to the scholarly community, society, the innovation landscape and industry
 For the scholarly community, the study will help both higher education institutions and the government improve teaching
 and learning outcomes, based on multiple facets of the student experiences in HEls and TESDA schools. On the part
 of the students, the study will instill in them greater responsibility to provide a real and complete picture of their
 academic experiences that will serve as basis for policy formulation or reformulation and curriculum development or
 reengineering. On the part of the society and the industry, the study can provide awareness of what skills and abilities
 that the students probably have developed undergoing such experiences and what else can the industry provide so as

Comparative Study Between Cytology and FTIR Fingerprint: A New Tool for Screening for Cancer,"Albano, Pia Marie Sp","Since most cases of cancer are curable if diagnosed early, there is the urgent need to
 evaluate novel biomarkers for their early detection. To help eliminate suffering and death due to
 cancer, research should focus not only on improving therapies but more on improving strategies in
 identifying individuals who are at risk of developing cancer and detecting cancer at early stages when
 they can be more effectively treated. Discovery of novel cancer biomarkers and development of
 assays for their early detection will benefit not only the general population but also the clinicians and
 other health professionals involved in cancer diagnosis, management, treatment, and prevention.
 Thus, this proposed study aims to evaluate the potential use of the FTIR fingerprint of
 sputum, pleural aspirates and thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in the non-invasive
 detection of lung and thyroid cancers, by observing the cluster patterns of their IR absorbance in the
 fingerprint region. The potential use of FTIR fingerprint analysis in cancer detection has been studied
 in different cancer types ‚Äî fibrosarcoma, melanoma, cervical, oropharyngeal, colon, colorectal cancer,
 gastric, esophageal, and prostate cancer [1]. However, most studies have utilized solid tumors
 already taken as biopsies ‚Äî an invasive technique commonly used when malignancy of the mass is
 suspected. In contrast, our proposal introduces a rapid, inexpensive, and less invasive method of
 early cancer detection using sputum, pleural aspirates and FNAB.
 We have initially verified this concept using formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsy
 samples from Filipino patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer. Our results showed clustering
 patterns of the vibrational spectroscopic patterns of the proteome of tumor and normal cells. Given
 our results, we want to apply this rapid yet inexpensive technique in detecting lung and thyroid
 cancers at its very early stage or even prior to tumorigenesis using samples acquired through less
 invasive procedures. This proposal will focus on lung and thyroid cancers as they have not been
 given much attention in terms of FTIR fingerprint analysis. Moreover, most studies have utilized total
 protein isolates. But this study will utilize a single type of macromolecule to minimize vibrational noise
 that may come from other macromolecules.
 Pleural aspirates and thyroid FNAB taken from patients with histologically confirmed lung or
 thyroid cancer will be considered as cases for this study. Samples confirmed to be non-malignant will
 serve as controls. Proteins from the biological samples of both cases and controls will be isolated
 following standard protocols. Principal cluster analysis will be done on the ATR-FTIR absorbance
 patterns of the proteins. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive
 value of FTIR as a potential non-invasive diagnostic test will be compared with imaging (MRI, CT
 scan, etc.) and histopathologic methods of diagnosis.
 ‚Ä¢
 
 This diagnostic method that we are proposing can be used as a rapid, inexpensive, and less
 invasive adjunct method for existing molecular and tissue-based methods of lung and thyroid cancer
 detection. Moreover, it is a high-throughput method that can be used for routine and early detection of
 tumorigenesis and tumor surveillance. Thus, it will benefit the general population particularly those
 who are at risk of developing said cancers. The in-house assay that will result from this project could
 have commercial viability. Since the products will be locally produced, they are expected to be more
 affordable to the ordinary Filipinos.
 This proposed project can serve as opportunity for UST researchers to form strong
 collaborative and sustainable research and innovation partnerships with fellow Filipino academics
 from public or private, big or small higher education institutions (HEls) to instill the culture of research,
 increase research productivity of HEls, and raise research quality and impact [2]. This project is
 multidisciplinary and involves industry partnership for eventual production and transfer of knowledge
 and technology from laboratory to bedside.",UST,Main
"Researching the Researchers: Challenges, Needs and Productivity
 
 Project Components:
 1. Research Skills and Productivity of Faculty Researchers
 2. Research Needs and Gap Analysis of Mentor-Mentee Needs among Faculty Researchers
 3. Research Challenges and 21st Century Research Competence of Faculty Researchers","Tadle, Rene Luis M.","Notably faculty members are the major drivers of research productivity in HEls. Yet most HEls faculty
 members are held from engaging in research. It is given that their research productivity is affected by confluence of
 individual, institutional, and leadership issues. This study aims to identify and analyze factors that contribute to dismal
 research productivity among Filipino academics, assess their needs and challenges, and offer possible solutions by
 way of policy recommendation and/or more appropriate interventions.
 This study is anchored on Vitae's Researcher Development Framework (2011) (www.vitae.ac.ukirdf) which
 consists of four domains namely: knowledge and intellectual abilities; personal effectiveness; research governance and
 organization; and the research engagement, influence and impact of the researchers. In the light of the Reseacher
 Development Framework (RDF), this study will consist of two phases. The first phase will determine faculty's research
 productivity and the factors that are normally associated with it, such as their research knowledge and skills, academic
 degrees teaching load, available time to do research, research efficacy, and the faculty's notions and beliefs about
 research. The second phase will determine the research needs and describe the experiences of the various typologies
 of researchers, such as first stage, early career, established, and leading faculty researchers (CM¬∞ 52, s. 2016)
 Studies that focus on research productivity in the Philippines are minimal. These studies are mostly in the
 form of dissertations, reports, and addresses delivered in conferences and fora that delved on the status of research in
 the Philippine academe. And to our knowledge there is only one published article that focus on research productivity
 of facutty members from state-owned HEls (Quimbo & Sulabo, 2014). This study will add to the literature by highlighting
 research productivity in private universities in the country as well. Higher education in the Philippines is private sector
 driven. Eighty-eight percent of HEls is private, catering to 2.2 million students comprising 54% of the tertiary student
 population in the country (Licuanan, 2016). Further, this study is anchored on specific types of researchers identified in
 CMO, 52 Series 2016. To our knowledge no similar study has been done yet in the Philippines. Knowing the research
 capabilities, skills, and weaknesses of the different types of faculty researchers in both public and private HEls, which
 in principle are expected to engage in research, could lead to formulation, creation and implementation of more
 responsive and effective research capacity building policies and programs.
 Due to the full implementation of K-12, CHED, in cooperation with HEls, has laid out alternative activities to
 address the threat of retrenchment and deloading for the affected faculty members. The agency has come with
 programs that includes engaging the faculty in research. It is believed that that the transition period is an opportune
 time to develop culture of research and maximize research productivity among faculty members (Bautista, 2015; Remo
 2015; Mateo, 2017). But the issue that comes to the fore is the level of preparedness and interest of the faculty to
 engage in research. Further, individual attributes and institutional characteristics exert influence on the motivation and
 behaviors of the faculty to engage in research activities (Bland et al., 2005). Thus, baseline data is needed so that
 policies and intervention encouraging the faculty to engage in research will be more nuanced to the specific research
 needs and experiences of faculty members.
 The results of this study may later serve as source of information in generating policy recommendations and/or
 more appropriate interventions to promote research productivity among different types of researchers.",UST,Main

 Project Components:
 1. Growth and Yield Modeling
 2. Site Species Suitability Assessment
 3. Pest and Disease Assessment
 4. Falcata-based Agroforestry System Income Analysis","Palma, Richmund A.","Sustainable and profitable management of Falcata-based agroforestry systems necessitates information on
 growth and yield. Falcate, a fast-growing and in-demand agroforestry tree species is widely planted in Misamis
 Oriental as components of agroforestry systems. To reduce pressure on natural forest, increase rate of carbon
 sequestration, promote ""trees on farm"" and protect tree farmers' investments, there is a need to study its growth,
 yield, pest and diseases and profitability. The objectives of the study are the following: 1) Develop growth and
 yield model for Falcate considering soil characteristics, elevation, wind direction, provenance, density and
 cultural practices; 2) Determine site-species suitability for Falcate in smallholder Falcata-based agroforestry
 system in Misamis Oriental derived from growth and yield model; 3) Assess the pests and diseases of Falcate
 plantation in Misamis Oriental; 4) Identify and map the location of smallholder Falcate ‚Äî based agroforestry
 system in Misamis Oriental using (3IS technology; 5) Determine the income of farmers from their Falcata-based
 agroforestry systems; and, 6) Disseminate appropriate management strategies in journal, conferences and print
 media.
 The outputs of the research study include growth and yield model for Falcate planted in an agroforestry system,
 site ‚Äî species suitability assessment for use by entry ‚Äî level tree farmers, pests and diseases mitigation
 strategy, income analysis and mapping of Falcate ‚Äî based farmers. These outputs will lead to an increase in
 adoption of Falcate ‚Äî based agroforestry system in Northern Mindanao, improve management of Falcate in a
 Falcate ‚Äî based agroforestry system, enhance agricultural system with the addition of Falcate, increase
 productivity of the agroforestry farmers.
 Site-species mismatch and pests and diseases are the two common causes of failure in tree establishment and
 management operations. Few studies (i.e. on growth, yield, site-species suitability and pest and diseases) were
 conducted on this species and land-use system. One of the reasons is the complexity in conducting simulation
 or modeling. The models can be used in site ‚Äî suitability assessment. It can also generate pests and diseases
 mitigation options. All these outputs can generate new knowledge not only the current situation of the Falcate in
 Falcate ‚Äî based agroforestry system, but also, the study can simulate the condition in future time plus the
 knowledge on pests and diseases.
 The study will generate many new knowledge that can be utilized in strengthening higher education institution
 offering agroforestry, forestry and agriculture programs. The growth and yield model that will he developed can
 be integrated into many subjects in agroforestry and forestry particularly in developing instructional materials.
 Similarly, the site-species suitability and pestsand diseases mitigation strategy is also useful in instruction,
 extension and production. These can be the technologies that can be extended to the farmers of Northern
 Mindanao by the students, faculty and extension/development workers. The publications of the research
 outputs are essential reference materials. Lastly, the experiences that will be gained by undergraduate and
 graduate students as collaborators of this study are important in inculcating research culture among students.
 This research/ innovation supports the economic development and social welfare of the poor people in the
 upland and lowland areas of the proposed sites. These people are embarking on an expensive, risky and
 laborious endeavour of establishing Falcata-based agroforestry system relying on the belief that by planting
 Falcate they can gain financial benefits. Driven by the current demand and price situation and government
 program (i.e. National Greening Program), these tree farmers must be protected by providing them with new
 technologies they can use that is specific to their site. Tree farmers have little knowledge on site-Falcata
 suitability, much more with the pest and disease management. These farmers should be empowered with the
 knowledge on growth and yield of Falcate, best site to plant, best management practices and protection from
 pest and diseases. These research/ innovation is geared toward higher production in terms of volume (m3) that
 could provide farmers with more profit which will enable them to avail of various social welfare services. Taxes
 gained can be utilized by the LGU in providing additional social welfare programs for these people. Similarly, the
 wood industry will also benefit in this study. Supply of logs for processing from many agroforestry tree farmers in
 
 Northern Mindanao will increase with enhanced management and productive tree farms. Aside from socio-
 economic benefits, the research study will encourage proliferation or adoption of ""trees on farm"" or 'trees
 
 outside forest"". Thus, deliberately reduce pressure on the remaining forest and improve the climatic condition of
 agricultural ecosystem.",USTSP,Claveria

 are the HEI faculty teaching or researching on Bangsamoro/Mindanao or Philippine history from Zamboanga,
 Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. Another group (for another proposal) may be formed in Mainland Muslim Mindanao.
 The project leader or full time research assistant shall visit the ZamBaSulTa provinces to speak with the Local
 Government Units (for possible in-house historians who have available materials) and send out inquiries and
 invites to HEIs to ascertain possible participants for the capacity-building project.
 The second phase of the project is the inception and conceptualization meeting of the participants, around 30
 Bangsamoro historians for the 4 provinces, and 2 or more experts. Preferably, the meeting will be held in
 Zamboanga City as it is the most accessible to Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. Expert historians will be invited,
 ideally from the University of the Philippines Diliman, De La Salle University ‚Äì Manila, UP Baguio, and other
 institutions relevant to History, Culture, and Tradition. These experts shall impart to the participants important points
 such as the value of history and on historiography including survey, assessment, oral tradition, etc., and handling of
 available sources for historical writing. By the end of the meeting, the participants should be able to return to the
 provinces and collect sources for historical writing.
 The third phase of the project is the collation of available related literature and oral tradition sources by the
 participants in their own provinces and libraries. The project leader and co-researcher may visit the National Library
 of the Philippines, National Archives, and other institutions that may house available materials on Bangsamoro
 history, culture, and tradition.
 The fourth stage is the writing workshop where the participants should bring the sources they found respectively
 and an expert historian-writer and education/publishing specialists will train the participants hands-on to incorporate
 the sources into the Anthology. By the end of the capacity-building project, there should be a draft Anthology
 already.
 The fifth stage is polishing and editing the Anthology through an editor. The project leader shall facilitate the
 process by constantly communicating with the editor and participant-writers on any updates about the anthology.
 Once polished, the anthology shall be ready for printing.
 The selection of the participants, experts, professionals, and others who are involved; as well as the decisions for
 content inclusion, exclusion, and modification shall be coursed through the approval of the steering committee,
 composed of two members from the BARMM Ministry of Education and representative from the Western Mindanao

 in Philippine history.
 The Bangsamoro Historians‚Äò Organization shall be formed and the Bangsamoro Anthology: ZamBaSulTa shall be
 disseminated to all possible HEIs primarily those in BARMM and Mindanao, and later including those in the
 Visayas and Luzon so that HEIs may have access to the anthology collated and written-up by the Bangsamoro
 themselves with discussions on Mindanao and peace/nation-building.
 The wider impact of the project to the society is that it bridges between the need of the Bangsamoro to narrate their
 past and the need of the greater public to understand Bangsamoro history, culture, and tradition vis-√†-vis
 contemporary struggles.

 HISTORY IN THE SOCIAL STUDIES
 History is a core subject in SSE that it sets the context and contextualizes the content of other Social Studies
 Education (SSE) subjects. All of the disciplines contribute to the students‚Äò overall understanding of society and
 social phenomena.
 According to Barton and Levstik (2010), there had been attention to reforming the teaching of history from
 transmission of information to the process of historical interpretation. Although teachers are familiar with the
 process and strategies in teaching history, they fail to integrate those into instruction.According to Wineburg, Mosborg, and Porat (2010), historical narratives come from everywhere, to include parks,
 buildings, documentary stamp, newspapers, TV, etc, and of course the home. Based on past experiences, parents
 shape their children‚Äòs historical consciousness; aside from parents, so do ethnic, racial, and religious groups. There
 is a tension between history taught in schools versus those in popular culture. Textbooks and curricula have a
 ‚Äïmemory gap‚Äñ that they do not mention ‚Äïeveryday notions‚Äñ of historical knowing.
 According to Vansledright (2010), source work is the building block of historical thinking that includes identification,
 attribution, judging perspective, and reliability assessment of the historical source. Conversely, children and
 adolescents‚Äîto some extent adults‚Äîapproach sources as decontextualized, disembodied, neutral. Vansledright
 suggests designing assessments that measure investigative skills of students and emphasizes that historical
 thinking is integral to critical thinking.
 According to Brophy and Alleman (2008), nineties elementary social studies tended to be defined by the textbook
 series used, which are sometimes combinations of trivia, fiction, and history. Nothing much of lasting value or
 higher-order thinking skills are imparted. Reformers consistently called for the shift from merely reading to
 engaging in discourse. In general, elementary teachers lack a big-picture perspective about SSE and its purpose is
 rather vague. Another trend seen in SSE is the reduction of time allotted to the subject. Curriculum is a major part
 in the learned skills of pupils in SSE and that research on children‚Äòs thinking about social studies is important and
 can be discovered by connecting to students‚Äò prior knowledge.
 According to Levstik (2008), restructured K-12 SSE emphasizes depth over breadth. Levstik mentions that time
 spent in SS subjects is crucial in the students‚Äò positive performance and that textbooks Wade (1993) analysed
 showed that they are biased, superficial, and poorly-written.
 Barton (2008) supposed that students‚Äò understanding of history derives from primarily the curriculum, among
 others. Barton proposes that future researches on students‚Äò idea of history be directed to long-term classroom
 studies of how these ideas change depending on the instruction; ‚Äï",WMSU,Main
"Optimization of Polyaniline Film Synthesis on Flexible Substrates for Smart Packaging Application
 
 Project Components:
 1. Optimization of synthesis procedure for nanostructured and optically homogenous polyaniline films
 2. Determination of suitable color space for the detection of TVBN
 3. Correlation of color values of polyaniline sensor to selected parameters","Fernando, Joel G.","Recently, diverse innovative processes in food freshness monitoring were developed into
 smart packaging systems. The most widely used scheme for freshness monitoring is detection of
 Total Volatile Basic Nitrogen (TVBN), which are gases evolved from microbial degradation of
 proteins. Although WON can be detected by using chromatographic analysis and electric nose,
 optical indicators are by far the simplest, most convenient and least expensive. Among optical
 indicators, polyaniline (PAni) is advantageous because it is free from leaching, accurate, simple,
 low cost, rapid, reliable, consumer friendly and non-invasive.
 In this project, polyaniline film-based freshness indicator that is responsive to total volatile
 basic nitrogen (TVBN) will be developed. Specifically, it aims to:
 optimize synthesis procedure for preparing nanostructured and optically homogenous
 polyaniline films on flexible substrates by varying the oxidant, type of substrate, doping procedure,
 dopant concentration and monomer-oxidant ratio;
 determine which color space is best suited for detection of TVBN using digital image-based
 colorimetry; and
 correlate color values of polyaniline sensor to pH values, TVBN concentration, microbial count
 of fish (Lapu lapu, Tuna and Milk fish) and meat (chicken and beef) products in chilled and ambient
 conditions.
 Polyaniline films will be synthesized via chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline in
 acidic aqueous solutions at ambient temperature and pressure. The synthesis conditions will be
 varied until an optimized procedure for preparing optically homogenous films, that are responsive
 to TVBN will be obtained. The synthesized films will be exposed to TVBN evolving from meat
 products and the color of the film will be monitored as a function of fish and meat's pH values,
 TVBN concentration, and microbial colony count. As proof of concept, our preliminary experiments
 have already revealed that polyaniline films responded with gas evolved from spoiling foodstuffs
 (chicken and fish) and the color PAni film correlated well with fish and meat pH.
 This project aimed at developing a reliable and inexpensive food freshness sensor is seen
 as an innovation for popular use. This contributes to public safety in food consumption and shall
 come to serve as an indicator against food spoilage and wastage ‚Äî a concern for food safety and
 security. The development of the sensor will also provide opportunities for the proponents to
 engage in R&D partnership with industries that market packed fish and meat products. The
 integration of the developed sensor in their existing packaging system will enhance food freshness
 monitoring and in the process improve product marketability and competitiveness
 Moreover, this proposed project will further enhance the research capacity of both
 institutions through collaborative research and increase productivity of faculty and students
 researchers in terms of publications, patents and presentations in national and intemational
 conferences. In effect, the academic programs directly connected to the project will be reinforced
 and the prospect of attaining/maintaining the Center of Excellence status will be strengthened.",WMSU,Main

 being physically adept to earn stable income and physically fit when natural hazards strike.
 Philippines experiences hazards often leading to disasters. Situations in evacuation centers, lack of nutritious food,
 aggravate miserable condition. Victims should meet daily nutritional requirement by eating healthy food with minimal
 preparation.
 While it is true Philippines is often visited by hazards, it is also a host to megadiverse biological resources being a
 tropical and maritime country. It is in this premise that we should tap these as a potential source of ingredients.
 Goal of the study is to develop a full-packed food item using unnoticeable raw materials but abundantly available and
 with high nutritional value. Research program has three (3) components:
 Evaluation and Analysis of Nutri-Chip and its Production
 Capability-building of Pilot Community
 Information Dissemination
 Raw materials will be obtained from Pangasinan and Nueva Ecija. Different formulations of nutri-chip will be tested
 and subjected to product quality analysis. Organoleptic evaluation will be conducted for social acceptability. Nutritional
 fact and microbial analyses determining shelf life of nutir-chips will be done. Cost-benefit analysis will be performed
 for project economic feasibility.
 Capability-building of people from Brgy Imbo, Anda, Pangasinan who will be involved in nutdchip production will be
 undertaken ensuring its sustainability. IEC materials (brochures, videos) about nutritional value and consumption of

 ROE Platform/a: Food Production and Security
 Objectives of the Program:
 General Objective:
 The main objective of the study is to develop a full-packed nutd-chip that is both nutritious and delicious out of the
 abundantly available and cheap raw materials of the country, which are mushroom, seaweed and moringa. The
 Municipality of Anda, Pangasinan is chosen as the pilot community. It is prone to natural hazards such as, coastal
 flooding and storm surge. There is also prevalence of malnutrition in the coastal barangays of Municipality of Anda.
 Specific Objectives:
 Determine the quality and social acceptability of the product;
 Determine the nutritional content and shelf-life of the nutri-chip;
 Determine the economic feasibility of the nutri-chip;
 Develop the capability of the communities involved; and
 Disseminate information about the nutri-chip.
 The Nutri-chip
 Nutri-chip is a nutrition-packed food that is palatable, delicious and convenient to eat anywhere and anytime. It is a
 thin-sliced chip made of three nutritionally valuable and locally available ingredients. It will be attractive to all ages
 because of its crunchy properties and right saltiness.
 Nutri-chips are thin slices whose moisture content decreases from around 80 percent to almost 2 percent when they
 are fried. Frying in hot oil at temperatures between 160¬∞ and 180¬∞C is characterized by very high drying velocities,
 which are critical to improve not only the mechanical but also the structural properties of the chips (Baumann and
 Escher, 1995). Nutri-chips will be subjected to vacuum frying as an alternative technique to develop low oil content
 chips.
 Vacuum frying may be an option for production of fruits and vegetables with low oil content and the desired texture and
 flavor characteristics. It is defined as the frying process that is carried out under pressures well below atmospheric
 levels, preferably below 50 Torr (6.65 kPa). Due to the pressure lowering, the boiling points both of the oil and the
 moisture in the foods are lowered. Vacuum frying poses some advantages that include: (1) can reduce oil content in
 the fried product, (2) can preserve natural color and flavors of the product due to the low temperature",WPU,Main

"DETERMINANTS OF Bt CORN (Zea mays L.) ADOPTION IN CAGAYAN VALLEY, PHILIPPINES","Naval, Rey C.; Dolojan, Fredisminda M.","Corn production in the Philippines is important as many farmers depend on corn farming as their main livelihood. Corn production contributed over 100 billion pesos annually on the country’s economy. However, in the early 1990s, the production of corn in the country is threatened by Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnaculis Guenee) which significantly reduce yield. To solve the problem, the use of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) corn gene which is resistant to stem borer was introduced thereby bringing sustainable increasing production. However, despite technology’s effectiveness, there are always factors which motivate or dismay farmers to adopt and these need to be known. The study utilized the 1,279 corn farmers in Cagayan Valley to determine the factors that influence their adoption of Bt corn technology. Using a logistic regression model, the results showed that a set of demographic profile and farm characteristics influenced the farmer’s decision to adopt the technology. The government should consider these factors to scale up the farmers’ adoption of the technology to ensure sustainable production to cater the rising demand on corn in the country and world today. Further study may be conducted to identify other factors contributory to the adoption of the technology.",QSU,Main

The public information sources (PuIS) were the municipal agriculture technologists, extension agents, experts/researchers, company technicians and sales representatives. The mass media sources (MmIS) include the broadcast medium (TV and radio) printed materials (newspapers, leaflets, brochures, package of technology, and posters, the internet and cellphone). Results showed that the PIS recorded the highest mean value of 5.47 in terms of frequency of contact, indicating a once a week information sharing particularly with family members, relatives and friends. Information sharing with their co-corn growers (4.83) however occurred two to three times a month. As to the degree of usefulness of the information, both the technical and economic information generated from all the information sources were adjudged as very useful. It means that any available information that they get from various sources were considered to be useful in their corn farming. In terms of the total information score (TIS), the highest was recorded in PIS with a mean value of 224.25 IS. The mean score falls under the strong information contact. It is an indication that corn growers have more frequent information exchange between and among their family members, relatives, friends and co-corn growers. Total information scores obtained from the PuIs and MmIS were low indicating a weak information contact. Contact with PuIs is once to three times a year, while contact with MmIS ranges from once - two years and to no contact at all.",QSU,Main

Students' Grade Inquiry Kiosk Using Biometric Fingerprint Authentication With SMS Notification To Parents,"Laranang, Mary Jane R.; Bermusa, Jenefer P.; Panganiban, Edward B.; Laranang, Sandy E.","Technological advancements have helped educators and institutions to be an aid in learning, whichhas been an advantage to big institutions as well as the small ones. These advancements have attracted more and more students to enroll in a particular institution, thus being a competitive advantage. With this modernization, more clients depend on the progress of technology, which convinces them to demand more efficient learning. Due to people's demand and lifestyle change, popularity for the development of the advanced technology employed is excellent. Almost everything used has been changed to better standards. A practical example is a grades viewing system, wherein parents need not worry about their children if they are going in or out of school. Therefore, the proponents came up with the idea of developing a system entitled, ""Students' Grade Inquiry Kiosk using  Biometric Fingerprint Authentication with SMS Notification to Parents."" The primary purpose of the system is to provide an automated viewing of student's grade with real-time SMS notification to parents. The Short Message Service (SMS) performs an essential role in an individual's daily lives. This research has successfully established and produced a reporting system to send notifications straightforwardly to the parent's mobile phone via SMS, thereby helping to ensure the data is delivered to all parents or students concerned. They were efficiently integrating this message system to provide a dependable and useful communication medium. The authors have created a system based on the conceptual framework and system architecture identified after defining the problems of the current issue. The researchers used alpha, beta, and acceptance tests to test the reliability of the device. The machine functions, which act as a test method, have been carried out. During the pilot test, the respondents were given a survey questionnaire about the performance of the system. The majority of the respondents rated the system favorably in terms of its functionality, reliability, and usability. This result confirmed that the system had performed its intended use.",QSU,Main
Students’ Online Learning Readiness and Internet Connectivity: Bases for the Customization of QSU e-Aral,"Yra, Jay Francis P.; Castillo, Rodrigo Jr. H.; Bautista, Romiro G.; Camayang, Jamina G.; Camayang, Arben Gibson G.","The declaration of pandemic due to CoViD-19 in March 2020 brought a radical change and shift of instructional modalities in education towards online modality due to the non-contact policy of the Philippine government as well as to the governing board of the Commission on Higher Education. Learning Management System involves synchronous and asynchronous learning modalities that can be offered in online and offline modalities. In this regard, the Quirino State University system tried to determine the online learning readiness of its students in its quest of customizing a Learning Management System - the QSU e-Aral. Employing the survey of the Descriptive Research and Developmental Research designs, the following are known: students at QSU are ready in going online classes except for being focused and being able to manage their time in going online; albeit, most of them lack a-priori online activities; students in QSU Maddela vouched inferior concordances in focusing themselves to online tasks and managing their time when compared to their counterparts in Diffun and Cabarroguis; and students at QSU are burdened with computer and internet rentals in cafes in their locality. Aptly, the proposed QSU e-Aral may be customized to have an offline and online feature to suit best the readiness, needs, and financial capability of QSU students.",QSU,Main
